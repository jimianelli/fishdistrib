ABSTRACT

Marine fisheries are crucial to the food security and nutrition, economy and overall
well-being of coastal communities. Maintaining the long-term prosperity and sustain-
ability of marine fisheries is therefore not only ecologically significant, but has social,
economic and political importance. The aim of this report is to provide FAO Members,
national and regional policymakers, academia, civil society, fishers and managers of world
fishery resources with a comprehensive, objective and global review of the state of the
living fishery resources of the oceans.
   This document updates the regular reviews of the state of the world’s marine fishery
resources, based on stock assessments and complementary information up to 2023, and
official catch statistics through to 2021. The introductory and methodology chapters
provide the wider context in which this updated edition of the Review of the state of world
marine fishery resources was prepared, highlighting evolutions in the landscape of fisher-
ies and stock assessment capacities since the previous edition of this report in 2011. The
methodology section gives a detailed overview of the updated FAO process for providing
the state of stocks index, which involved a highly participatory and transparent process
(including 19 regional workshops and consultations, with around 650 in-person experts
representing 92 countries and 200 organizations). Importantly, the total number of
stocks in the assessments included in this report has significantly increased to 2 570.
Discussions on major trends and changes at the global level are explored in a dedicated
global overview chapter, while more detailed information on the status of stocks for each
of the FAO Major Fishing Areas is set out in dedicated regional chapters. Special sections
address the global issue of tunas and tuna-like species, and other high-profile fisheries
such as deep-sea fisheries in areas beyond national jurisdiction, and highly migratory
sharks. Summary tables are provided for each species grouping used in this assessment,
indicating the number of stocks included, their sustainability classification between
overfished, maximally sustainably fished, and underfished categories, and the number of
stocks classified into tiers based on the availability and quality of information and thus
the assessment methods used.

FOREWORD

With only five years left to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, it is
becoming increasingly clear that many of the goals set forth by the global community
remain out of reach. Pervasive hunger and malnutrition, worsening impacts from climate
change, and political conflicts remain significant challenges. These realities underscore the
urgent need to manage our natural resources more effectively and efficiently. Currently,
Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14 is among the least-funded Goals, and achieving
SDG 14.4 – which calls for the regulation of harvesting, the elimination of overfishing
and illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, and the implementation of
science-based management plans to effectively manage and restore fish stocks – appears
increasingly uncertain. Nonetheless, global efforts have continued to push forward
towards achieving sustainable fisheries. This report aims to provide a critical foundation
for ongoing dialogue and action needed to achieve effective fisheries management.
   The Review of the state of world marine fishery resources reports have become vital tools
for informing policy and management at multiple levels, from international frameworks
such as the United Nations SDGs and the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement to
climate negotiations, biodiversity conventions and agreements, and potentially global
trade agreements like the World Trade Organization Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies.
They serve as a resource for decision-makers across the FAO Committee on Fisheries
(COFI) and other key institutions, helping to drive evidence-based discussions and
strategies.
   The origin of this report traces back to 2020, when the need for a more participatory
and transparent approach to collating and reporting global fisheries assessments became
apparent. In response, a tiered assessment approach was developed, incorporating exten-
sive stakeholder engagement and scientific rigour to ensure a comprehensive and inclusive
process. Initial consultations were conducted virtually in 2022, followed by the first
in-person meetings later that year. Between 2022 and 2024, more than 650 participants
from 200 organizations across 92 countries contributed their expertise through 19 consul-
tations and workshops. By December 2024, the final workshop had been conducted, and
in early 2025, a prelude of the report was delivered at the Honiara Summit on SDG 14
(24–27 February 2025, Solomon Islands), leading up to the official global release at the
third United Nations Ocean Conference (UNOC) in June 2025.
   This updated analysis indicates that the proportion of marine fishery stocks fished
within biologically sustainable levels was 64.5 percent in 2021. While these global results
are close to previous estimates, regional results show a diverse degree of differences
compared to the previous approach, a consequence of using a more representative list of
assessed stocks than previously. When weighted by their production levels, stocks classi-
fied as biologically sustainable accounted for 77.2 percent of the total landings in 2021.
   Beyond its technical contributions, this initiative has served as a platform for build-
ing stronger personal and professional networks across the global fisheries community.
It has facilitated collaboration between experts, institutions and policymakers, fostering
a deeper commitment to improving fisheries assessments and management and build-
ing capacities. This comprehensive community engagement approach has ensured that
knowledge and expertise from national to regional – and ultimately global – levels has
been leveraged.
xvi




         Every effort has been made to conduct a thorough and rigorous assessment through
      the application of the new methodological approach. Nevertheless, as better data and
      information become available in the future, there will be opportunities for improvement
      and refinement. These will be addressed in future iterations, and we encourage the global
      community to build upon and sharpen this work.
         This report represents, without a doubt, the most comprehensive, evidence-based,
      community-built assessment of global fish stocks to date, providing a strong foundation
      for informed management policies. If used effectively, it can help us accelerate efforts
      to ensure that 100 percent of stocks are placed under effective management as called
      for by FAO’s Blue Transformation vision, and achieve the ambitious goals of the 2030
      Sustainable Development Agenda and beyond.
         The development of this report would not have been possible without the dedication
      and collaboration of countless experts, institutions and stakeholders who have contrib-
      uted their knowledge, time and expertise. Their collective efforts have been instrumental
      in shaping a more transparent and science-driven approach to fisheries sustainability
      monitoring. As we move forward, it is imperative that we build on this momentum, ensur-
      ing that the health of our oceans, the livelihoods of millions, and the future of marine
      resources remain at the forefront of global decision-making.

KEY MESSAGES
THE UPDATED STATE OF STOCKS:
A MAJOR MILESTONE IN FISHERIES ASSESSMENT

 Since the early 1970s, recognizing the importance of assessing the biological
   sustainability and long-term production potential of marine fisheries, FAO has
   been providing regular updates of the state of marine fishery resources, initially
   through periodic reviews, and eventually as part of the biennial FAO The State of
   World Fisheries and Aquaculture reports.
 This report provides the most comprehensive, reliable and participatory assessment
   of the status of global fisheries resources to date, involving over 650 experts from
   more than 200 institutions across 92 countries, making use of the best available data
   and information and using 2021 as the base year.
 In this analysis 2 570 disaggregated stocks were assessed, compared to around
   450 aggregated stocks used in previous FAO assessments. This expansion and
   disaggregation in the reference list of stocks provides a more representative and
   granulated coverage, including 778 stocks from the Indian Ocean, 828 from the
   Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean and the Black Seas, 903 from the Pacific Ocean,
   and 15 from the Antarctic region. In addition, 46 stocks of highly migratory tunas and
   sharks are included. This provides better information to monitor the state of resources
   at regional and sub-regional level, for example in areas like the Indian Ocean, where
   the number of assessed stocks has increased tenfold, and the Central Pacific, which
   sees a fivefold increase in coverage.
 The analysis includes fish stocks responsible for 74.2 percent of all marine fishery
   landings in the base year and is thus an appropriate proxy of the state of global fisheries
   resources.
 Transparency is central to the analysis, which applies a tiered approach to the
   representation of stocks across FAO Major Fishing Areas:

   ■ TIER 1:
     Stocks with formal numerical assessments conducted at national or
     regional levels (1 519 stocks).
   ■ TIER 2:
     Stocks without formal stock assessments, but where enough data and
     information are available to infer status using surplus-production
     model approaches (566 stocks).
   ■ TIER 3:
     Data-poor stocks, whose assessments can only be determined applying
     weight-of-evidence methods and approaches (485 stocks).

   Future iterations may expand the reference list of stocks and/or make adjustments
   between tiers, depending on data availability and methodological improvements,
   further enhancing accuracy and coverage.
xxvi




        While this updated estimate of the sustainability of marine fish stocks is a major
          milestone, improving accuracy and granularity, nonetheless gaps in data and
          information persist in some regions. The report highlights where further investment
          in data collection and assessments are needed to ensure representativeness and
          completeness in future evaluations.
        The updated analysis also provides a significant degree of harmonization in the
          criteria used for the assessment. FAO’s analyses have always been based on the principles
          laid out in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which calls for
          States to maintain or restore populations of harvested species at levels which can
          produce their maximum sustainable yield (MSY). To account for uncertainties
          in biomass estimation and natural fluctuations in stock sizes, this analysis considers
          that a stock is overfished if its biomass is below 80 percent of the biomass that allows
          maximum sustainable yield (BMSY), and underfished if its biomass is above 120 percent
          of BMSY, be that for deliberate management action or because the fishery has not
          reached its potential. However, sustainability thresholds differ in some regions, and
          this is explained where appropriate.
        With increased coverage, higher-resolution data, and a new tiered approach, this
          analysis will help the community to better understand and communicate the state
          of fishery resources, inform national, regional and global policy dialogues, and
          facilitate discussions on fisheries strategies and sustainable use of marine living
          resources. Furthermore, the analysis provides information in support of indicator
          14.4.1 of the Sustainable Development Goals, which measures the proportion of
          fish stocks exploited within biologically sustainable levels.


       PROGRESS AND CHALLENGES IN FISHERIES
       SUSTAINABILITY

        The proportion of marine stocks fished within biologically sustainable levels was
          estimated to be 64.5 percent for the base year (2021), with 35.5 percent of stocks
          classified as overfished. The proportion of overfished stocks continues to increase
          at a rate of approximately 1 percent per year in recent times, which is a significant
          concern. This underscores the urgent need, aligned with the goals of FAO’s Blue
          Transformation Roadmap, to strengthen effective management across all fisheries.
        The results also indicate that a larger number of commercially fished stocks are
          reported as underfished compared to previous assessments. This may be due to the
          expansion in the reference list of stocks and the availability of finer scale information
          for some stocks, but also the result of deliberate precautionary measures being
          implemented in the management of some stocks.
        When weighed by their production levels, approximately 77.2 percent of the fishery
          landings in the base year (2021) were estimated to be from biologically sustainable
          stocks. This could indicate that, on average, stocks with larger landings tend to be
          more sustainably managed, highlighting how effective management supports the
          recovery and long-term sustainability of fishery resources.
        The analysis presented focuses on the widely used objective of maximizing long-
          term sustainable yields of fishery resources. While this may not be the preferred
          management objective everywhere, the results should inform policy dialogues
          that attempt to balance conservation objectives with food security, economic
          development and livelihood objectives.
                                                                                              xxvii




FAO MAJOR FISHING AREAS HIGHLIGHTS

 At a regional level, and despite large variability, differing assumptions and
   uncertainties, some high-level patterns emerge:

   ■ In Areas with strong management systems in place, such as the Northeast
     Pacific (Area 67) and Southwest Pacific (Area 81) sustainability rates
     (92.7 percent and 85.5 percent, respectively) were higher than in other areas.
   ■ The semi-enclosed Mediterranean and Black Seas (Area 37), and the
     Southeastern Pacific (Area 87), still face challenges, with only about
     35.1 percent and 46.4 percent of fish stocks in the respective Areas considered
     to be sustainably exploited, despite significant progress being observed in
     recent years.
   ■ In the Eastern Indian Ocean (Area 57), around 72.7 percent of stocks
     were estimated to be sustainably exploited. However, caution is required in
     interpreting this result as some vulnerable species may not have been included
     in the list of stocks due to the unavailability of data.
   ■ In the Eastern Central Atlantic (Area 47), management efforts, including
     to reduce bycatch, have resulted in 33.3 percent of fish stocks being assessed
     as underfished. However, these underfished stocks accounted for just 5.9
     percent of the Area’s total landings, thus having little impact on the overall
     sustainability of fishery landings in this region.

KEY SPECIES HIGHLIGHTS

 Of the top ten species by declared landings – anchoveta, Alaska pollock, skipjack
   tuna, Pacific chub mackerel, Atlantic herring, yellowfin tuna, Pacific sardine,
   European pilchard, blue whiting, and Atlantic cod – 60.0 percent of the stocks
   were considered to be biologically sustainable, partly reflecting the number of
   overfished cod stocks, while 85.8 percent of their landings, were estimated to be
   from biologically sustainable stocks.
 The status of tunas and tuna-like species demonstrated the impact of strong
   management action, with 87.0 percent of stocks considered sustainable in 2021
   and 99.3 percent of landings coming from biologically sustainable stocks. This
   is particularly due to the implementation of effective management plans by fishing
   nations through regional fisheries management organizations.
 Deep-sea fisheries continue to face challenges. Given their long lifespans, these species
   are particularly vulnerable. Only 29 percent of deep-sea stocks were sustainably
   fished, except in the Antarctic Area where 100 percent of exploited stocks were
   estimated to be sustainably exploited.
 Highly migratory sharks face ongoing pressures. These sharks are mostly caught as
   bycatch in longline fisheries, though some are targeted. About 56.5 percent of these
   stocks were considered sustainable. These highly migratory shark species have cross-
   jurisdictional ranges that require international cooperation to implement management
   measures and secure their conservation and sustainable use.

1. BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
Marine fisheries represent a critical source of food and nutrients, livelihoods, culture and
well-being to billions of people worldwide. According to FAO (2024), aquatic animal
foods contributed to at least 20 percent of the per capita protein supply from all animal
sources to 3.2 billion people in 2021. Moreover, the high value of aquatic foods as a source
of micronutrients and omega-3 fatty acids provides an opportunity to address important
nutrient gaps, including for vulnerable communities who depend on aquatic foods for their
diet (Hicks et al., 2019, Basurto et al., 2025). Furthermore, aquatic food systems play a
crucial role in supporting the livelihoods of many coastal communities, with FAO (2022)
estimating that 600 million people rely, at least partially, on the aquatic food sector (e.g.
for direct consumption, employment, and trade or export revenue). Yet, aquatic foods are
threatened by climate change, pollution, biodiversity loss, and unsustainable practices,
including overexploitation and illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. These
threats also present a challenge for science, contributing to uncertainty in data, assessments
and thresholds for interpreting results, and therefore, to properly inform management
decisions.
   Fisheries production is strongly influenced by oceanographic conditions, which affect
the distribution and productivity of fish stocks, the availability of nutrients, and the over-
all health of marine ecosystems. Ocean circulation redistributes heat and water across
the globe, influencing local climates. Ocean currents transport larvae and support fish
migration, and play a vital role in the availability of nutrients (FIGURE A.1), particularly
in upwelling areas where nutrient-rich deep water is brought to the surface, supporting
high biological productivity and ultimately the growth and abundance of fish and other
marine organisms (Barange et al., 2018).
   Changes in oceanographic conditions, such as those related to climate change, can
have significant consequences for fisheries, potentially leading to shifts in the distribution
and productivity of fish populations and thus impacting the food security, nutrition and
livelihoods of coastal communities (IPCC, 2019).
   Evidence shows that when fisheries are properly managed with specific objectives to
maximize benefits and avoid the risk of overfishing, their stocks are consistently found to
be close to abundance levels leading to maximum yield in a sustainable way (also known
as maximum sustainable yield, MSY) (Hilborn et al., 2020; FAO, 2022; FAO, 2024).
This highlights what can be achieved with adequate management actions, to ultimately
support the rebuilding of fishery stocks (Sharma, 2023). Stock assessments are a corner-
stone of effective management, providing critical data and knowledge for informed
decision-making. For example, when weighted by their production levels, an estimated
77.2 percent of the 2021 landings from FAO-monitored stocks (i.e. stocks that are in the
updated reference list which includes 2 570 stocks that are being used as indicators for
sustainability) were from stocks classified as sustainable (maximally sustainably fished or

                             underfished), which is significantly higher than the world average of 64.5 percent when
                             assessed by number of stocks.
                                Maintaining fish stocks at or above, or restoring them to, levels that can produce MSY
                             is mandated by many international agreements and frameworks, including the United
                             Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS, 1982), the United Nations Fish
                             Stocks Agreement (UNFSA [UN, 1995]), and the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible
                             Fisheries (FAO, 1995). To monitor progress towards meeting the objectives of these inter-
                             national frameworks and agreements, as well as to ensure the long-term sustainability of
                             and benefits from fisheries resources, assessments of the state of fish stocks must be under-
                             taken to support effective policies and management strategies. As the UN agency with a
                             mandate for fisheries, FAO – in partnership with Members, i.e. countries – is committed
                             to providing the international community with the most accurate and reliable informa-
                             tion on the state of exploitation of marine fishery resources (FAO, 2011).
                             1.1 Background on FAO’s review of the state of world marine fishery
                             resources
                             For over half a century, FAO has regularly provided an overview of the global and regional
                             state of marine fishery resources to support policy formulation, decision-making and the
                             long-term sustainability of fishery resources. The first assessment was published by FAO
                             in a seminal study by John Gulland in 1971. From 1974 to 1997, the analysis of the state
                             of stocks was regularly updated through Fisheries Circulars, and subsequently became
                             the object of several Fisheries Technical Papers – Review of the state of world marine fishery
                             resources – published in 1994, 2005 and 2011. Since 1997, the assessments of the state
                             of world fisheries resources have also been updated biennially in FAO’s flagship report:
                             The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture (SOFIA).

   Over time, the statistics and information provided in these reports have become a
global reference in discussions on the status and trends of stocks in global and regional
fisheries. Currently, the biennial updates on the status of fishery resources, included in
SOFIA reports, constitute the most authoritative global and regional analysis of the
state of exploitation of marine fish stocks around the world, ranking among the most
frequently cited references in fisheries (Branch and Linnell, 2016) and consolidating
SOFIA’s reputation as one of FAO’s most impactful publications. To promote consist-
ency and comparability across time, FAO’s analyses of the state of fish stocks have been
based on two pillars since the start of the series: (1) a reference list of fishery resources (e.g.
aggregated stocks) used as a proxy to track the state of fisheries around the world, and (2)
a defined methodology for classifying individual fish stocks into one of several catego-
ries of state of exploitation. Both of these, with the exception of minor adjustments, have
remained consistent since 2011 (FAO, 2011). Data, statistics, and information included
in this flagship report series have been helping scientists, policy- and decision-makers,
and stakeholders whose livelihoods depend on the sector to improve the sustainability
of fisheries (Ovando et al., 2021).
   However, over the years, significant changes have occurred in the rapidly evolving land-
scape of world fisheries, especially with regard to the tools available to assess and monitor
marine ecosystems, and the requirements for estimating and presenting global informa-
tion. These include changes in how society values fishery resources at national and regional
levels, as well as ways in which fish stocks are targeted and harvested. Moreover, the data
and tools available for assessing the exploitation status of fish stocks have continued to
improve, and now often rely on a variety of data sources (including Indigenous and tradi-
tional knowledge). New computationally intensive estimation methods, machine learning
and the use of decision-support tools, as well as more sophisticated empirical approaches
suited for data-limited fisheries, have also enabled a substantial increase in the number of
stocks that are and can be assessed. Finally, rethinking what “sustainable fisheries” means
in different fisheries management contexts from the perspective of inclusion, agency and
local participation in decision-making has influenced the procedures and requirements
for estimating and reporting on global information on the state of fisheries.
   The development of additional monitoring processes under international, regional,
national and local frameworks has also resulted in the need for more efforts to improve
alignment and transparency between FAO and these initiatives. For instance, the
Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicator 14.4.1 (Proportion of fish stocks within
biologically sustainable levels) has generated its own national monitoring and reporting
requirements. As such, it is important for FAO to ensure that the list of stocks consid-
ered in this review both nationally and globally, as well as the approaches and methods to
classify fish stocks into the different categories of state of exploitation, are as consistent as
possible with these other initiatives, that these monitoring processes are well connected,
and that related information is readily available. Improved access to publicly availa-
ble information has enabled high-impact FAO reports like SOFIA to reach ever-larger
audiences, increasing their influence on the discourse surrounding the sustainability of
marine resources.
1.2 Updated methodology
Recognizing the dynamic nature of fisheries resources and the fisheries sector as well as
the need to ensure that relevant knowledge from regions is used in the assessment process,
FAO has undertaken an in-depth review of its methodology to estimate and report on
the state of exploitation of marine fishery resources. The aim of this review is to improve
knowledge about stock status and reduce information gaps, and thus support more
effective regional and global policies.
   The updated methodology provides more representative, comprehensive and complete
indices, as they are calculated on a wider set of disaggregated stocks (2 570 stocks) that
are considered to be the most important in the current social, economic and ecological
A   4                                                            Review of the state of world marine fishery resources




        context of fisheries across the world (APPENDIX II , pp. 415). The updated approach allows
        for a higher-resolution assessment of the state of resources in each region, and enables
        continued improvement through identification of potential gaps in assessment and
        facilitation of actions to address them. The methodological update expands the scope of
        available information and increases its alignment with SDG reporting initiatives, thereby
        strengthening the evidence base for decision-making in the sector.
           The updated methodology also represents a paradigm shift towards a more open, trans-
        parent and participatory analysis and reporting format, while maintaining the integrity of
        the FAO index time series. Recognizing the crucial role of regional, national and local fish-
        eries experts in the provision of advice to fisheries management, including the determination
        of the exploitation status of fish stocks, this updated methodology involves the develop-
        ment and improvement of capacities of local, national and regional fisheries institutions to
        assess the exploitation state of the stocks, particularly those with limited information. This
        approach aims to encourage and facilitate greater participation by these institutions, so
        their regular analyses can be considered in the FAO global and regional analyses, consistent
        with national reporting on SDG indicator 14.4.1. The methodology is therefore not only a
        better tool for assessing the overall status of exploited fish stocks, but also acts as a catalyst
        for empowering national and regional institutions and communities responsible for deliv-
        ering sustainable fisheries to more effectively monitor and assess their fishery resources.
           The updated methodology’s more accurate understanding of the status of fishery stocks
        of interest, both globally and regionally, will enable governments and other decision-makers
        to better address issues related to assessment and the management of fisheries in their juris-
        diction. It will therefore support global efforts to increase the contribution of sustainable
        fisheries to food security and nutrition while respecting ecological boundaries. This effort
        aligns with FAO’s Blue Transformation vision, the objectives of which include achieving
        the effective management of 100 percent of marine and inland fisheries (FAO, 2022).

        2. PURPOSE OF THE REPORT
        This document updates the FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture Technical Paper No. 569,
        Review of the state of world marine fishery resources (2011), as well as expanding and
        complementing the information provided in relevant fisheries sections from the more
        recent SOFIA reports. The main objective of this report is to provide a full update on the
        state of marine fishery resources at the global and regional levels since the last compre-
        hensive review published in 2011 (FAO, 2011). The report provides a detailed description
        of the methods used for preparing, calculating and reporting on the state of world fish
        stocks, and a comparison with the results obtained using the previous methodology. The
        organization and presentation of the document closely follows the previous major reviews,
        but several changes have been introduced in response to suggestions provided by readers
        of previous editions and reviewers of the current document.
           This report comprises five main sections. After the introduction, the second section
        details the methodology used in the current analysis. The second section provides a global
        overview of the exploitation status of marine fishery resources; and the third section
        provides regional overviews of marine fisheries resources. The latter is organized into 16
        sub-sections, each corresponding to a FAO Major Fishing Area for Statistical Purposes,
        that summarize information on major trends and changes in the status of key fishery
        resources, as well as stock assessment efforts supporting fisheries management. The fourth
        section of the report focuses on special topics requiring in-depth analysis, including tuna
        and tuna-like species, deep-sea fisheries and highly migratory sharks . Finally, the docu-
        ment includes a comprehensive list of tables, detailing stocks analysed and their status
        based on the updated methodology, as well as the methodology used for estimating land-
        ings of assessed species not mapped to FAO FishStat database.

Since its first publication of the global review of marine fish stocks
in 1971 (Gulland, 1971), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the
United Nations (FAO) has been regularly assessing and reporting on the
state of world marine fish resources with the aim of supporting policy
formulation and decision-making for the long-term sustainability of
marine fisheries at a global level. This section describes the methodology
used to produce the results presented in this report, with a particular
focus on the modifications to the methods used since the last update
to the methodology in 2011 (FAO, 2011).


1. THE PROCESS
Over a period of two and a half years (2022–2024), FAO developed and implemented an
updated methodology for assessing and reporting on the state of fish stocks. This process
was participatory, decentralized and inclusive, engaging national and regional institutions
and experts. It enabled a more comprehensive and high-resolution assessment that includes
most of the regional and local assessments in the world, and that is better aligned with
regional management needs. This undertaking involved 19 regional workshops and online
consultations, with around 650 in-person experts representing some 90 countries and
200 organizations.
   This broad dialogue with fisheries institutions from FAO Members and regional fish-
eries bodies (RFBs) was critical to defining key elements of the updated methodology. For
instance, it supported the identification of what can be considered separate stocks based
on local ecological, social and economic contexts, as the reference list of stocks upon which
the global assessment is based was also revised. The process for updating the methodology
was designed with capacity development as its core feature, especially benefiting data- and
capacity-limited regions. Engaging with national and regional institutions early in the
process strengthened their capacity to actively contribute to the state of stocks assessment
and supported future streamlining and standardization of the assessment process. This
more collaborative and transparent approach conveys greater legitimacy to the FAO stock
status methodology and increases confidence in the results.

        2. ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES
        2.1 FAO index of the state of exploited marine fishery resources
        FAO reports on the state of marine fishery resources in a given FAO marine region using
        a basic index of the overall condition of the marine resources, as originally proposed by
        Gulland (1971). This index is an estimate of the number of stocks in a particular category
        or state as a fraction compared to the total number of stocks in the area being assessed.
        The category or state is the current biomass of the stock as a fraction of the biomass giving
        maximum sustainable yield (MSY). This fraction is known as BMSY. The estimate is calcu-
        lated on a non-random sample of the stocks exploited in a specific area, selected to include
        the stocks currently of commercial importance, and thus more likely to be managed. This
        sample is denominated the “reference list” for the index in that region. The formula below
        summarizes the index:


        where pi is the proportion of stocks in the reference list that are in the category of state
        of exploitation i, Ni is the number of stocks in the reference list that are classified into
        that same category, and N is the total number of stocks in the reference list from the area.
           Some of the stocks used in the calculation constitute a much larger proportion of the
        total catch, and therefore aquatic foods, than others. To account for the difference in rela-
        tive contribution of stocks to the overall fisheries production, the index is also calculated
        in terms of the declared landings, as:


        where qi is the proportion of the total declared landings allocated to stocks in the reference
        list that is allocated to stocks classified into the category of state of exploitation i, Wi is
        the sum of the declared landings allocated to stocks in the reference list that are classified
        into that same category, and W is the total declared landings allocated to stocks in the
        reference list of stocks from the area. Sometimes, species assessed had no recorded landings
        in the FAO FishStat database; in those cases, the global not elsewhere included (NEI)
        categories was allocated to those groups using a proportional ratio-based algorithm of the
        assessed stocks.1 The coverage of assessed landings refers to the proportion of total declared
        landings that are assigned to assessed stocks, relative to the total declared landings in a
        given area or globally. For this analysis, the declared landigns used to calculate coverage
        include highly migratory species, such as sharks, tunas, bonitos and billfishes, even though
        these species are excluded from the analysis of stock status presented in the area-specific
        chapters, as they are addressed separately in Part E on Special topics.
           This index is calculated for 18 of the 19 marine FAO Major Fishing Areas for Statistical
        Purposes (hereafter, FAO Major Fishing Areas or Areas) (FIGURE B.1) – Area 18 is not
        included because the available data for this region was insufficient. Moreover, the index
        for Areas 88, 48 and 58 is reported as aggregated because all these Areas are under the
        jurisdiction of the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources
        (CCAMLR). An Area is a geographically defined region used by FAO to organize the
        collection and analysis of statistics on global fishing activities; their boundaries were
        determined in consultation with international fishery agencies taking into account, to the
        extent possible, various considerations (e.g. natural boundaries, existing national practice
        and boundaries, the distribution of aquatic fauna, resources, environmental conditions,
        areas of competence of existing fishery commissions) (FAO, 2015). The limits of the
        Areas were set in the 1950s and have not been revisited since. It must be noted that some
        Areas – such as Areas 41, 51, 57, 71, 77 and 87 – are too large to have natural boundaries,
        and have been defined based mostly on statistical convenience.

            While the formula for the index itself is simple, defining what exactly a stock is, which
         stocks should be included in the reference list from a particular region, and how they
         should be classified into categories of state of exploitation are complex, value-laden,
         context-specific decisions filled with uncertainty. As such, the assessment procedures for
         estimating and reporting on the FAO state of stocks have been organized into the follow-
         ing steps, facilitating a clear understanding of decisions taken at each juncture:

         a. Defining the criteria for determining the state of exploitation.
         b. Defining the categories of state of exploitation.
         c. Defining the criteria for classifying stocks into each category
            (of state of exploitation).
         d. Defining the reference list (i.e. the sample of assessment units (stocks)
            to be classified for each Area considered in this work).
         e. Collecting/collating data and information relevant to the classification of
            stock status for the assessment units (stocks) included in the reference list
            agreed in step (c), per the criteria defined in step (d).
         f. Classifying the assessment units (stocks) included in the reference list (step d) using
            criteria in step (c) into the different categories of stock status (step b).
         g. Estimating the value of the FAO state of the stocks index (i.e. the percentage
            of stocks classified into each category of stock status, based on either the number of
            stocks or the weight of catch by stock) for the world and for each relevant Area, based
            on the outcomes of the classification of stocks in the reference list for each Area.
         h. Building the time series of the FAO state of the stocks index for the world
            and for each relevant Area.

         2.2 Defining the criteria for determining the state of exploitation
         The state of exploitation of a fish stock is normally assessed based on the relationship between
         stock abundance and productivity, and particularly referring to the concept of MSY. It is
         useful to note that the fishery productivity (yield) of a stock is around zero if unexploited
         and maximal when its biomass reaches BMSY. If exploitation continues to increase above
         MSY, then the stock biomass will decline below BMSY as well as the fishery productivity.
             MSY remains a guiding principle of fisheries management. For example, the United
         Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS, 1982), the United Nations Fish
         Stocks Agreement (UN, 1995) and the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries
         (FAO, 1995) require fish stocks to be maintained at levels that can produce MSY or to be
         restored to such levels. There are several MSY definitions in practice, including equilibrium
         definitions that were commonly used when UNCLOS was signed to more recent ones that
         are based on the average yield from a fixed F and with inclusion of uncertainties or variation
         in production (e.g. determined through simulation). Keeping stocks at or above a level that
         is able to produce the maximum production also corresponds to maximizing the sustainable
         production of aquatic foods from these stocks, and is therefore in line with FAO’s mandate.
         It is important to note that MSY is a single species construct, which does not necessarily
         apply to management in a mixed stock complex; this is intricately connected with biodiver-
         sity in a system. In such fisheries, realistic multi-species targets need to be determined that
         may conflict with the single species MSY construct (Fulton et al., 2022).
             Fisheries science indicates that the stock can be harvested (i.e. yield taken) continu-
         ously without affecting its sustainable yield (MSY) depending on the abundance of the
         stock relative to its BMSY. The sustainable yield is low when there are very low or very high
         levels of abundance (and natural productivity is very low), and it is maximum (MSY) at
         some intermediate level (where natural productivity is highest). The actual catch depends
         on the stock and tends to vary naturally around its long-term average. The exploitation
         state of a fish stock is defined on the basis of its level of abundance relative to BMSY (i.e. on
         whether its abundance is lower, equal or higher than the current BMSY).
             FAO recognizes that while fish stocks are often managed to extract the maximum, aver-
         age production of food from them in a sustainable manner, management objectives related
         to livelihoods, cultures and wellbeing, as well as biodiversity conservation and nature-for-
         nature values, are important and are also pursued in certain fisheries jurisdictions. Many
         other stocks are already managed with economic (e.g. to maximize sustainable revenue)
         or environmental (e.g. to minimize impact on ecosystems) objectives, thus aiming at
         targets other than BMSY, both resulting in yields lower than MSY. In some management
         contexts, “sustainability” has been interpreted to mean having a low risk of collapse, and
         if this interpretation is used, a fish stock can be fished down to levels of biomass below
         MSY and still be “sustainable” in the long term, provided its capacity to replenish itself is
         not compromised (this is often referred to as the limit reference point [Haddon, 2011]).
         These scenarios recognize that fisheries management often involves multiple objectives
         that are not always related just to maximising yields.
             This work will not consider these multiple views or the desirability of alternative measures
         of state of exploitation. For consistency with previous works and with FAO’s mandate, it
         considers only the abundance of the stocks relative to their single species BMSY, using this as
         the yardstick to measure the state of exploitation of the marine fishery resources of the world.
         This primarily comes out of UNCLOS, where fishing occurs above MSY and not beyond
         the point where reproduction is threatened, and is thus used for evaluation purposes here.
         2.3 Defining the categories of state of exploitation
         Exploited fish stocks whose abundance is above or close to the biomass that produces the
         optimal MSY (BMSY), in line with UNCLOS, are classified by FAO as
         “maximally sustainably fished”, while those with abundance well below BMSY are labelled
         “overfished” and those with abundance well above BMSY are classified as “underfished”.
         The classification as “underfished” implies that the stocks could produce more catch if
         fishing was increased. The classification of “overfished” refers to stocks that could generate
         greater yields if allowed to recover, and is therefore relevant from a food production point

of view. While it is possible to subdivide each of these three levels into sublevels, based
on considerations such as the trend in the estimates of biomass or fishing mortality, this
subdivision is very uncertain for most fish stocks; as such, since 2011, FAO only uses these
three categories of state of exploitation (underfished [U], maximally sustainably fished
[M], and overfished [O]) (FIGURE B.2).
2.4 Defining the criteria for classifying stocks into each category
(of state of exploitation)
The classification of the state of exploitation of fishery stocks refers to the method by
which stocks are classified into the different categories of exploitation, designated in this
report as underfished, maximally sustainably fished, and overfished.
    The estimation of the exploitation level of a fish stock, and thus its classification into
one of the three categories of state of exploitation, is very difficult to carry out with preci-
sion and accuracy, not only because it is difficult to estimate the biomass of fish stocks,
but also because the precise value of BMSY will fluctuate as a consequence of variability
in the natural environment. Taking into consideration this uncertainty, FAO applies a
buffer of 20 percent of uncertainty around the estimate of BMSY to define the “maximally
sustainably fished” state. Thus, any stock for which the estimation of the ratio between
current biomass (BCURR) and BMSY (BCURR/BMSY) is between 0.8 and 1.2 is classified as
“maximally sustainably fished” (FIGURE B.2). Consequently, only stocks for which the
estimate of this ratio is above 1.2 are classified as “underfished”, and those for which the
estimate is below 0.8 are classified as “overfished”.
    FAO Members are also interested in understanding the patterns and trends in the sustain-
ability of exploited fish resources. Therefore, this work also reports on the evolution of the
estimated percentage of sustainable stocks across time. Related initiatives, such as SDG
indicator 14.4.1 that define “biologically sustainable stock” as “a stock of which abundance
is at or greater than the level that can produce [MSY]”, don’t explicitly consider natural vari-
ability of BMSY values and uncertainty in their estimates; for the purposes of this report, a
range of abundance values, from 0.8 BMSY to 1.2 BMSY, is considered for the stock to be clas-
sified as “maximally sustainably fished”. Accordingly, the estimator for the proportion of
biologically sustainable stocks for a given Area is the proportion of stocks classified as either
“maximally sustainably fished” or “underfished” in a subset of stocks from that region that
were assessed for state of exploitation.2

                   However, there are some exceptions to this. Some national and regional fisheries organ-
                izations use a classification system that is not directly based on BMSY and the thresholds
                described above, but rather on other reference points. These differences, and the implica-
                tions they have for attempts to compare stock status between regions, are discussed in more
                detail in the chapters for these Areas.
                2.4.1 Updated methodology:
                A three-tiered approach to classifying stock status
                Given that availability and quality of data and information vary greatly among regions,
                FAO’s classification methodology should capture these differences. In some regions, data
                and knowledge are relatively abundant for most stocks, enabling the use of more informa-
                tion-intensive, data-rich stock assessments. In other regions, experts may only have access
                to reported landings for almost all stocks, restricting assessments to data-poor methods.
                   To address some of these challenges, FAO has updated its methodology for classifying
                fish stocks. A tiered approach to classification was introduced that is more flexible, trans-
                parent and replicable, and that maximizes the use of available information. Each of the

         assessments
                          The data and analysis have been scrutinized for validity using clear pre-agreed criteria. If no serious
                          flaws were found in either the data or the analysis, the stock status was derived directly from the
                          assessment report (i.e. no reanalysis of the data was performed). If, by contrast, serious flaws were
                          found, the stock was placed into one of the other two tiers and its status was classified using the
                          corresponding methods.
                          A Tier 1 assessment should use a reliable methodology and verifiable data, and should currently be
                          used by a jurisdiction for direct fisheries management. The assumption used for Tier 1 is that there is
                          a review process either at a regional or national level that ensures that the assessment is reliable.
                          The reference list used in the current assessment includes 1 519 stocks that fall into this category.


         TIER 2           Tier 2 includes stocks for which a formal assessment has not been conducted or deemed
         Surplus-         sufficiently reliable (e.g. assessments that may be outdated or not peer-reviewed), but a reliable
         production       time series of catches is nonetheless available, accompanied by sufficient auxiliary information (e.g.
         model
                          external data on landings with abundance indices, standardized catch per unit effort [CPUE], expert-
         approaches
                          driven priors for depletion), which can be used to infer stock status by fitting a model based on surplus
                          production (e.g. stock reduction analysis plus [SRAplus]).
                          These stocks were assessed collaboratively by FAO and regional and national experts using surplus
                          production model type approaches to infer stock status in dedicated regional workshops. The data
                          and information available were screened using a clear set of criteria in order to establish that auxiliary
                          information was sufficiently reliable to proceed with model-based assessments.
                          The reference list used in the current assessment includes 566 stocks that fall into this category.

         limited
                          Instead, stock status is assessed with indirect indicator-based methods, such as weight-of-evidence
         approaches
                          approaches which may rely on trends in CPUE or length-based indicators. These types of assessments
                          make use of all available qualitative/semi-quantitative data, knowledge and information, and are
                          often accompanied by a peer-review process.
                          The reference list used in the current assessment includes 485 stocks that fall into this category.

three tiers encompasses variable types of data and information, which are associated with
specific and distinct stock assessment methods.
   Fish stocks were sorted into tiers based on the type of assessment, data and information
available for the stock, using a clear decision matrix. All stocks were placed in the highest
possible tier given the data and information available. TABLE B.1 and FIGURE B.3 set out the
criteria for the decision matrix for each tier.
TIER 1
CRITERIA FOR CLASSIFICATION OF FISH STOCK STATUS
To fit the criteria for “traditional” stock assessment, the following forms of analysis were
considered: age-structured (Stock Synthesis, SS3), length-structured (MULTIFAN-CL,4
CASAL,5 SS), integrated assessments and/or surplus production approaches using Bayesian
techniques and random effects (JABBA,6 SPICT,7 SAM8) (Nielsen and Berg, 2014; Berg
and Nielsen, 2016) or specific models developed to suit the life-history and specifics of the
species being assessed that were built using programming languages like ADMB,9 TMB10
and R.11 Tier 1 assessments were made based on more than 20 years of data on landings
along with either a survey or a standardized CPUE series, and age/length data if available.
   The assessments in this class should normally undergo a peer review process as adopted
at some of the tuna regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs) or in national
and other fisheries advisory institutions with a long history in dealing with large stocks in
developed countries (e.g. ICES, the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization [NAFO],
the North Pacific Fisheries Commission [NPFC]). However, the review process varies
in terms of rigour from a data-rich to a data-poor context which generates assessments
that do not necessarily have similar review processes, yet are still used to provide the best
available scientific advice required by UNCLOS on the status of the stock and the type of
management to be followed.
TIER 2
CRITERIA FOR CLASSIFICATION OF FISH STOCK STATUS
The criteria for sufficient auxiliary data for Tier 2 assessments adopted in the updated
methodology are that a minimum of 20 years of catch landings data are used along with
other supplementary information like effort, CPUE and/or survey time series for a period
associated with the landings (ideally for the entire series but at least for 10–15 years overlap-
ping with the landing information). In order to classify stocks into different categories of
state of exploitation, FAO uses the software SRAplus12 (Ovando et al., 2021) using datasets
that include catch and effort/survey/CPUE series. Over the last decade, FAO explored
the possibility of using time series of officially declared catches to assess the state of fish
stocks using catch only models (COMs). Although the COMs were initially considered a
promising approach, recent detailed studies have shown that results tend to be influenced
by model structure, priors and other assumptions rather than by the catch data itself, and/
or conditioned by management actions rather than represent true stock status (Sharma et
al., 2021; Ovando et al., 2021). They require significant volumes of high-quality additional
data and information such as CPUE or comparable metrics, to provide acceptably precise
estimates on the level of “depletion” (current abundance relative to unexploited state). In
most cases this type of data is not available, so they are not able to produce better or more
reliable status estimations compared to expert opinions. Therefore, the solution for an
improved assessment is to generate better auxiliary data for inference.

         CRITERIA FOR CLASSIFICATION OF FISH STOCK STATUS
         If the amount of detail and/or quality of data were found to be insufficient for either
         Tier 1 or Tier 2 approaches, the stocks were assessed with Tier 3 methods. The status of
         stocks in this tier was categorized by applying a ‘weight-of-evidence’ approach that uses
         all available sources of data or information that can provide evidence on the exploitation
         state of fish stocks, from complex integrated models to expert knowledge, in a documented
         process validated by a clear algorithm and decision support system. The weight-of-evidence
         approach is an approach used to support evidence-based decision-making (Stobutzki et
         al., 2015).

         2.4.2 Uncertainty
         In this report, uncertainty is assessed at two levels: at the level of each individual stock
         and at the level of each FAO Major Fishing Area.
            The uncertainty at the level of individual stocks describes how certain we are about
         the classification of that stock into a given category of exploitation state. In other words,
         it communicates the level of confidence in the assessment based on expert knowledge
         about data, information sources, assessment model reliability, or the trustworthiness of
         the assessment process itself – for example, the frequency, independence and rigour of the
         peer-review process. In general, the more detailed the peer review, the more confident (less
         uncertain) we are about the results of the classification of that stock.
            The uncertainty at the level of each FAO Major Fishing Area refers to how certain we
         are about the proportions of stocks in the reference list in the Area estimated and reported.
         This is related to the overall uncertainty of the assessments of the stocks in the reference
         list, and is in turn associated with the overall quality of the information available and
         the capacity to analyse it.
            In general, uncertainty is aligned with the type of assessment (Tiers 1–3). Where data
         are sufficient to support a full stock assessment, uncertainty is considered low. Where an
         index-based approach is used, current status is less clear and uncertainty is usually medium
         unless there is more information supporting a more precise stock status. Finally, high
         uncertainty is usually associated with poor assessments such as from Tier 3.
            This evaluation considers integrated assessments and index-based assessments that have
         well-defined reference points as having low uncertainty.

2.5 Defining the reference list of stocks
To promote consistency and comparability across time, FAO has updated the reference
list only occasionally since the beginning of the time series in 1974. Moreover, the set of
stocks was determined by aggregation patterns in the data on landings that were reported
to the FAO Statistics Office (now FAO Statistics Division), resulting in lists that did not
necessarily reflect societal values. The most recent (minor) update to the reference list was
made in 2011 (FAO, 2011).
   Nevertheless, the relative socioeconomic and cultural importance of different fisheries
resources has changed appreciably over the last few decades. For many of the FAO Major
Fishing Areas, the stocks in the 2011 version of the reference list needed to be updated to
better reflect evolved biological knowledge, management arrangements, reporting expec-
tations and socioeconomic values. A more transparent and representative reference list
was therefore needed, as well as a process for revising the list periodically for it to remain
up-to-date. This revised methodology for determining the status of stocks index therefore
includes a significant update to the reference list.
   The reference list used in this work was selected through a participatory process with
local, national and regional experts to increase the representativeness of the stocks most
relevant to the fisheries of each Area (for more information, see PART C, GLOBAL OVERVIEW,
pp. 20). The methodology for developing this updated and more comprehensive reference
list involved a desk search of published and grey literature on stock assessments or descrip-
tions of fisheries, combined with consultations with fisheries institutions and experts from
relevant countries and non-governmental organizations in each Area to identify stocks
of national or regional importance. These consultations were integrated into the broader
regional and national consultations held as part of the overall process for updating the
full methodology (see section 1 of this chapter).
   The new assessment units identified through this process were then reconciled with
those in the 2011 reference list by using the finest level of resolution to obtain a more
comprehensive reference list for each Area (stock and species lists were aggregated in the
past, while the update uses stock-specific units). The criteria for inclusion of a stock in
the reference list are as follows:
 Assessment units or stocks with a formal assessment. The main stocks with a
      recent formal assessment were included and the existence of such assessments is a
      clear indicator of the importance of these stocks.
 Assessment units or stocks included in national reports for SDG indicator 14.4.1.
      A selection of stocks included in national reports for SDG indicator 14.4.1 were
      included based on expert advice for the region.
 Assessment units or stocks of national or regional importance, as indicated by
      the level of declared landings or by literature (published and grey literature).
 Other stocks, selected based on expert advice, to improve the representativeness
      of the reference list as a sample of all the exploited fish stocks in each Area.
   The updated reference list has grown from fewer than 150 in 1974, to 590 aggregated13
species-based assessment units in 2011 (FAO, 2011), to 2 570 assessment units in this
report (APPENDIX II , pp. 415). The increase in the recent report largely corresponds to
management units within exclusive economic zones of countries or transboundary stock
units. This change was largely a result of a shift in the means by which assessment units
are identified. Previously, the reference list primarily consisted of species groups. Within
a species, there may have been one unit or ten management units, but the entire group of
units was classified based on the dominant one (i.e. the one with the largest catch). Thus,
there was often a mismatch between the group assessment by FAO aggregates and the

13
     Aggregate means that even if a number of distinct management units are available, only one species was assessed
     as a whole.

                     actual status of the different management units within that group. Now, the updated
                     methodology has increased the resolution of stocks being assessed so that assessment
                     units are more likely to correspond to management units and assessment and manage-
                     ment initiatives at national or regional level.
                       With this updated approach to developing the reference list, this report also aims to
                     more closely align with other monitoring processes (importantly, including national
                     reports on SDG 14.4.1 [BOX B.1], if agreed to by the peer review group at the consultative
                     workshops). Indeed, over the last decades, monitoring processes have multiplied as the
                     ocean has increasingly been brought to the forefront of global conversations. Improving
                     consistency across these reporting frameworks will improve confidence in the results.
                     2.6 Collecting and collating data and information relevant to the
                     classification of stock status for the assessment units (stocks)
                     included in the reference list
                     To collect and collate data and information to classify the stock status for each assessment
                     unit in the reference list, FAO combined the knowledge of FAO experts (including regional
                     experts such as technical secretaries of RFBs) with that of experts from national and regional
                     institutions. The involvement and active participation of local, national and regional insti-
                     tutions in the process for data collation and analysis was vital for ensuring that locally
                     available knowledge and information was used in the calculation of the FAO status of stocks
                     index for the different FAO Major Fishing Areas. The deep involvement of these experts
                     also broadened the range of knowledge and representativeness of information compared
                     to previous global assessments. This consultation process was accompanied by internal
                     protocols designed to ensure the objectiveness of the FAO analysis. The final decisions on
                     the individual classifications and the overall status, however, are those of FAO.

                     2.7 Classifying the assessment units (stocks) included in the
                     reference list into the different categories of stock status
                     Once the data were compiled, each stock in the reference list was classified (Tier 1) or
                     assessed and classified (Tiers 2 and 3) into one of the three categories of state of exploita-
                     tion by applying the methodologies defined for each tier. FAO brought all the data and
                     assessments to the regional expert workshops, where the experts reviewed the work and
                     were able to suggest modifications and improvements. This was followed by an internal



            BOX B.1
            INDICATOR 14.4.1 PROPORTION OF FISH STOCKS
            WITHIN BIOLOGICALLY SUSTAINABLE LEVELS


            This indicator measures the sustainability of the world’s marine capture fisheries
            by their abundance. A fish stock of which abundance is at or greater than the
            level that can produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is classified as
            biologically sustainable. In contrast, when abundance falls below the MSY level,
            the stock is considered biologically unsustainable. The indicator will measure
            progress towards SDG Target 14.4.

                             TARGET 14.4
            By 2020, effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal, unreported and
            unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices and implement science-based
            management plans, in order to restore fish stocks in the shortest time feasible, at least to levels
            that can produce maximum sustainable yield as determined by their biological characteristics.

results presented in this report.

2.8 Estimating the value of the FAO state of the stocks index
Once the stocks in the reference list were classified into the corresponding categories of
state of exploitation, FAO staff and experts applied the simple formulas for the index to
compute the proportion of stocks (in number and in weight) classified into each category
in the reference lists for each Area. The proportions calculated for the reference lists were
used as the estimates for each Area and for the world as a whole.
2.9 Building the FAO state of stocks index time series
To build the time series of the estimates of the state of exploitation of fish stocks for each
Area, the values estimated for the last year of data were appended to the previous ones,
now making a time series from 1970 to 2021.
   While there have been appreciable changes in the detailed methodology used to
compute the index across time, this has not changed its nature as an estimator of the
proportion of the exploited fish stocks in each category of state of exploitation, even
though the set of stocks assessed changed with time and the methodology was updated.
FAO considers the accuracy of the estimator have been increasing along the time series, as
a result of improvements in the methodology, and particularly having a more representa-
tive reference list of stocks used to compute the estimates of these proportions.
   Starting with fewer than 150 different species groups in 1974, the reference list used
to calculate the index has grown almost twenty-fold to 2 570 in 2021, as individual stock
units are now used, some of which were previously aggregated in a species grouping. The
improvement in granularity since the last update is substantial. It is now possible for FAO
to build a more accurate representation of the current state of global fisheries compared
to the past, and relate status to fishery management. In particular, the quality of the esti-
mator will have improved more forthose Areas with weak representation in the past due
to representation in the past due to limitations of data and capacity. This gives a more
comprehensive view of the state of exploitation of global marine fishery resources.
   The FAO index is a proportion, and each edition of the global assessment was based
at the time on the best available and data-driven estimate of the state of exploited fishery
resources. However, the resolution has moved from an aggregate species basis to a higher
stock resolution. There have been some changes in the status categorization by Areas,
arising mostly from a more complete reference list. However, comparisons with the year
2021, using both the previous and updated approach, showed that the global estimate of
status over time has been reasonably consistent. This provides some assurance that the
improvements in the methodology did not significantly compromise the integrity of the
time series. However, it is important to note that some individual Areas have experienced
substantial changes, and that the distribution of maximally sustainably fished and under-
fished stocks have also changed.

3. MAIN DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE METHODOLOGY
ADOPTED IN THIS REPORT AND IN PREVIOUS EDITIONS
Prior to 2011, the methods used to classify the state of exploitation of fishery stocks
were more dependent on the information readily available to the experts analysing the
information and data and their decisions, and methods were not standardized. In 2011,
the method for classifying stocks into categories became more standardized (TABLE B.2).
The following four indicators in the classification of stock status were used: (1) stock abun-
dance, (2) spawning potential, (3) catch trend, and (4) size/age composition. The ability
to use these indicators varied according to the availability of data (FAO, 2011). Indeed,
for a large bulk of unassessed stocks in the Global South, catch trends and substantiated
expert opinions were used to classify the stocks. Alongside the four suggested categories of
classification indicators, the 2011 methodology also included an approach for estimating
B   18                                                                Review of the state of world marine fishery resources




                and reporting uncertainty, organized in three categories (low, intermediate and high),
                reflecting the robustness of the data and methods used. This uncertainty score was meant
                to help determine how best to make use of assessment results (FAO, 2011).
                   The updated methodology for assessing the state of fishery resources is more responsive
                to local values and management efforts, while striving to maintain, as much as possible,
                the consistency of the time series. The methodology is based on a devolved and collabo-
                rative model of scientific research, while strengthening capacity, trust, and agency among
                countries and RFBs.
                   As the methodology is more transparent and replicable, assessments can be more easily
                verified. In addition, the assessments are more representative of the likely status of stocks
                on the ground. Numerous unassessed/data poor stocks have been added in this state-of-
                stocks index and so the sample size and representativeness has increased, but these stocks
                have also increased the level of uncertainty. Nonetheless, accuracy has improved because
                of the assessment methodology has improved; the range of models used, their level of
                sophistication, and the number of experts involved better reflect the details of activities
                on the ground.
                   Notwithstanding the widespread consultation and the efforts to standardize the
                methodology, there are still differences in the quality and coverage of information across
                regions, as well as in some of the assumptions made. Caution should therefore be exercised
                in attempting to compare stocks’ status across regions using this methodology.
                   A key intention of applying this updated methodology is to decentralize a significant
                part of the work that goes into multiple global assessments, in favour of more transparent
                bottom-up approaches valuable for local management contexts, while informing policies
                and regional decision-making in an objective manner. The aim is for these improvements
                to continue in future iterations of this report, as the commitment of the global commu-
                nity of experts whose time, wisdom and effort made this new collaborative methodology
                possible.

The 2025 Review of the state of world marine fishery resources was
developed over the course of three years, 2022–2025. It follows the same
overall approach as the previous editions of this report, but with some
important changes to the methodology and process that are described in
detail in the previous section (PART B, METHODOLOGY, PP.6).
   The main modifications to the process were:
a. an increase in the participation of national and regional experts in the assessment, with
   around 650 experts globally (480 in person and 170 online), 200 national institutions,
   regional institutions and non-government research organizations, and 92 countries
   (FIGURE C.1);
b. an important update and expansion of the reference list of stocks to be assessed (from
   584 aggregated stocks in 2011 to 2 685 disaggregated stocks1 in 2025, of which 2 570
   were assessed in this report, APPENDIX II , pp. 415); and
c. the explicit splitting of the reference list of stocks into three “tiers” (TABLE C.1, FIGURE C.2),
   based on the best data and information available and methods used to classify them into
   one of the three categories of state of exploitation: “underfished”, “maximally sustainably
   fished” or “overfished”. These categories were based on similar thresholds as in 2011,
   with stocks considered “overfished” if the biomass was estimated to have fallen below
   80 percent of the level expected to maximize long-term yield (i.e. B/BMSY < 0.8 or the level
   that regional experts considered equivalent if the estimates of BMSY were not available).
1. STATUS AND TRENDS OF RESOURCES
1.1 Global status and trends
Results from the updated analyses indicate that the percentage of fishery stocks classified to
be within biologically sustainable levels (i.e. not “overfished”) in 2021 (latest data available)
was 64.5 percent (TABLE C.2 , FIGURE C.3). While these global results are close to previous
estimates – 64.6 percent in 2019 and 65.8 percent in 2017 – regional estimates show a diverse
degree of discrepancies from the previous approach (TABLE C.3). It is worth noting that these
calculations treat all fishery stocks equally, regardless of abundance, declared landings or the
level of uncertainty in assessments. When weighted by their production levels, 77.2 percent
of assessed stocks were classified as biologically sustainable in 2021.
   Of the total number of assessed stocks classified as biologically sustainable in 2021, those
classified as maximally sustainably fished and underfished accounted for 41.6 percent and
22.9 percent of the total number of assessed stocks in 2021, respectively, and for 50.7 percent
and 26.5 percent of stocks when weighted by landings, respectively. The recent increase in
underfished and decrease in maximum sustainably fished stocks is due to the large number
of extra species added into the reference list of stocks from Areas that previously reported few
species (e.g. Areas 51, 57 and 71); overall, these did not impact the estimate for the portion
of sustainable stocks. However, this does not mean that there is large potential to exploit
more in these Areas, as effort has likely exceeded optimal capacity level in these regions.
   As a result of the application of a more accurate and granular methodology for estimat-
ing coverage, assessed stocks accounted for 74.2 percent of total landings in 2021.

    Some of the disaggregated stocks were sub-stocks of aggregated species examined in 2011 and subsequent analysis.

     Notes: (1) In Area 67, Pacific salmon stocks were excluded from the analysis for the Area, as they are small in terms of biomass and
     managed as a distinct unit. When accounting for Pacific salmon stocks in the Area, 20.5 percent of the stocks were estimated to be
     unsustainably fished in 2021. (2) As they are genetically distinct ecologically significant units and are managed by stock by the relevant
     nations they are accounted for and evaluated for the global analysis. (3) More information is available in SECTION 2.3 in this chapter and in
     CHAPTER D.11 on Area 67, pp. 228. (4) Percentages might not add up to a total of 100 due to rounding.

1.2 Major trends by FAO Major Fishing Areas
In 2021, among the 18 marine FAO Major Fishing Areas reviewed (FIGURE C.4), the
updated analysis shows that the Antarctic Area (Areas 48, 58, 88), Northeast Pacific2
(Area 67), Northeast Atlantic3 (Area 27) and Southwest Pacific (Area 81) had the high-
est proportion (100–75.8 percent) of stocks classified as fished at sustainable levels.
In contrast, the Mediterranean and Black Sea (Area 37) had the lowest proportion of
stocks classified as sustainably fished (35.1 percent), followed by the Southeast Pacific
(Area 87) with 46.4 percent, the Eastern Central Atlantic (Area 34) with, 47.4 percent,
and the Western Central Pacific (Area 71) with 52.9 percent. Other Areas varied between
58.0 percent and 72.7 percent (TABLE C.3 , FIGURE C.3). Declared landings vary greatly
among FAO Major Fishing Areas (TABLE C.5, FIGURES C.5 and C.6), therefore the signif-
icance of each Area for the weighted sustainability of global fisheries depends on its
proportional contribution.

       PERCENTAGES OF BIOLOGICALLY SUSTAINABLE AND UNSUSTAINABLE FISHERY STOCKS IN
       2021, BY FAO MAJOR FISHING AREA




       Notes: (1) The percentages represent the proportion of sustainable stocks. Notwithstanding the widespread consultation and
       the efforts to standardize the methodology, there are still differences in the quality and coverage of information across regions,
       as well as in some of the assumptions made. Caution should therefore be exercised when attempting to compare stock status
       across regions using this methodology. (2) Highly migratory sharks and tunas, as well as Area 67 Pacific salmon stocks, are
       excluded in this representation. (3) Refer to the disclaimer on page ii for the names and boundaries used in this map.

    In Area 67, when accounting for Pacific salmon stocks, 79.5 of the stocks were biologically sustainably fished in
    2021. Pacific salmon stocks are small in terms of biomass and each is managed as a distinct unit.

    The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) uses Bpa as the reference point for management
    considering it as a proxy for BMSY. The ICES estimates are used here and shown in Figure C.4. However, an analysis
    done by Winker and Cardinale (ICES, 2022) demonstrates this is more akin to Blim (the point at which the stock
    reproduction is threatened).

                      The temporal pattern of the declared total and stock-specific landings for a specific Area
                   often reveals information about its ecological productivity, fishery development and manage-
                   ment stage, as well as fishery stock status. In general, after excluding Arctic and Antarctic areas,
                   which have minor landings, three groups of patterns can be observed (FIGURES C.5 and C.6):
                   (i) Areas with a continuously increasing trend in landings since 1950 (Grainger and
                   Garcia, 1996); (ii) Areas with landings oscillating around a stable value since 1990, asso-
                   ciated with the dominance of pelagic, short-lived species; and (iii) Areas with an overall
                   declining trend in landings following historical peaks.
                      FAO Major Fishing Areas 34, 51, 57 and 71 can be classified into the first group; while
                   Areas 61, 67 and 77 are classified into the second group; and the remaining Areas 21, 27,
                   31, 37, 41, 47, 81 and 87 are considered as belonging to the third group.
                      An increasing trend in landings (first group) may signal growing fishing activity and/
                   or (less frequently) a growing stock biomass as well as a change in species composition.
                   If these are not new fisheries, it may mask the overfishing of some stocks. On the other
                   hand, a declining trend in landings (third group) typically indicates either a deterioration
                   in the abundance of fishery stocks, socioeconomic changes that reduce demand, or the
                   enforcement of stringent management measures. According to the results of the analyses
                   presented here, the first (increasing landings) and third (declining landings) groups of
                   Areas have the lowest percentage of stocks classified as being at biologically sustainable
                   levels (59.0 and 60.6 percent respectively), while the second (stable or fluctuating land-
                   ings) group has the highest (75 percent).
                      Landings statistics by FAO Major Fishing Area for the last three years, as well as marine
                   landings in recent decades, are presented in TABLE C.5.

         1.3 Status and trends by major species
         1.3.1 TOP TEN SPECIES
         The top ten species in terms of declared landings in 2021 were anchoveta (Peruvian anchovy,4
         Engraulis ringens), Alaska pollock5 (walleye pollock, Gadus chalcogrammus), skipjack
         tuna6 (Katsuwonus pelamis), Pacific chub mackerel7 (Scomber japonicus), Atlantic herring
         (Clupea harengus), yellowfin tuna8 (Thunnus albacares), Pacific sardine9 (Sardinops sagax),
         European pilchard (sardine, Sardina pilchardus), blue whiting10 (Micromesistius poutassou)
         and Atlantic cod11 (Gadus morhua) (TABLE C.6). In 2021, the landings from 85.8 percent
         of these species were classified as biologically sustainable. However, when measured by
         the number of stocks, this figure drops significantly to 60.0 percent of the stocks classified
         as biologically sustainable, partly due to the significant number of overfished cod stocks.
            These highly productive and economically valuable species are, on average, in better
         condition than other species globally. They are also more likely to be accurately assessed, as
         they tend to be more abundant and of greater commercial importance. Still, some stocks,
         such as Pacific chub mackerel, Atlantic cod and Alaska pollock, were overfished in 2021.
         Most of these are Tier 1 stocks, meaning they were formally assessed at the national or
         regional level using traditional stock assessment models suited for data-rich stocks.
         1.3.2 HIGHLY MIGRATORY TUNAS
         Across the seven species of major commercial tuna, 23 stocks are assessed (six albacore tuna
         [Thunnus alalunga], four bigeye tuna [Thunnus obesus], four bluefin tuna [representing
         three species Thunnus thynnus, Thunnus orientalis and Thunnus maccoyii], five skipjack
         tuna [Katsuwonus pelamis] and four yellowfin tuna [Thunnus albacares] stocks) by tuna
         regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs), with all their member countries
         participating in the scientific review process.
             Declared landings of the main commercial tuna species12 were 5.2 million tonnes in
         2021, a 10 percent decrease from 2019. Fifty-eight percent of the catch was skipjack tuna,
         followed by yellowfin (30 percent), bigeye (7 percent) and albacore (4 percent) in 2021.
         Bluefin tuna accounted for just 1 percent of the global tuna catch by weight in 2021, but
         it is a very valuable species, both culturally and commercially.
             Globally, 87.0 percent of tuna stocks were classified as sustainably fished, and 14 percent
         were classified as overfished in 2021.13 By weight, 99.3 percent of the total catch came from
         biologically sustainable tuna stocks in terms of yield (the remainder was from overfished
         bluefin tuna stocks and one albacore stock).
             The tuna RFMOs have been making a concerted effort to use management strategy
         evaluations to provide advice for rebuilding and keeping stocks at biomass levels above
         the maximum sustainable yield (MSY), with encouraging results.


         4
            Peruvian anchovy has been constantly among the most-caught species in all years apart from 1983 and 1984.
         5
            Alaska pollock and Atlantic herring have been constantly among the most-caught species with highest declared
            catches, 1974–2021.
         6
            Skipjack tuna made it to the top ten in 1978 and has remained there since 1983.
         7
            Pacific chub mackerel has been among the most-caught species in all years apart from 1991, 1992, 2000 and
            2001.
         8
            Yellowfin tuna was among the most-caught species in the 1989–1994 period, 1998 and since 2001.
         9
            Pacific sardine was among the most-caught species, 1974–2000, 2010–2011 and from 2020.
         10
            Blue whiting is consistently among the top landed species.
         11
            Atlantic cod was among the top ten caught species in the 1974–1997 period, 2011–2019 and again in 2021.
         12
            After World War II, global tuna catches were dominated by large, long-lived temperate species. Over time, as
            total tuna catches increased, these species declined, and catches shifted toward shorter-lived, more productive
            tropical tuna species, which now make up a larger share of the catch.
         13
            ISSF (2023), which uses a different definition for the proportion of stocks considered to be sustainably fished,
            reports that 61 percent of tuna stocks are sustainably fished, 17 percent are overfished and 22 percent are in an
            intermediate stage. Also according to ISSF (2023), 85 percent of the total tuna catch comes from healthy stocks.

1.3.3 HIGHLY MIGRATORY SHARKS
Historically, many directed shark fisheries have experienced patterns of overharvest, rapid
stock decline, collapse, and limited recovery (Bonfil, 1994). Total reported landings peaked
at over 868 000 tonnes in 2000 and have since declined to approximately 605 000 tonnes in
2021. Landings of highly migratory species (UNCLOS Annex I) remained high (approx-
imately 250 000 tonnes) until 2012, before declining to around 170 000 tonnes by 2021.
   This report examined 23 pelagic shark stocks covering 7 species (porbeagle [Lamna
nasus], blue shark [Prionace glauca], shortfin mako [Isurus oxyrinchus], oceanic whitetip
shark [Carcharhinus longimanus], silky shark [Carcharhinus falciformis], thresher [Alopias
vulpinus] and pelagic thresher shark [Alopias pelagicus]). Overall 56.5 percent of the stocks
were at biologically sustainable levels in 2021, while 43.5 percent were overfished. When
weighted by landings, 82.0 percent of the landings were from stocks assessed at biologically
sustainable levels in 2021. While large pelagic stocks are generally considered sustaina-
bly fished and managed under the tuna RFMOs, small pelagic stocks such as the oceanic
whitetip shark, shortfin mako and porbeagle continue to exhibit a poor stock status.
   Progress in species-specific data collection and reporting has significantly improved
scientific research, bycatch mitigation, and stock assessments for several shark species,
including blue shark, silky shark and oceanic whitetip shark (Rice and Harley, 2012,
2013; Rice et al., 2013; Rice and Sharma, 2015). The International Plan of Action for
the Conservation and Management of Sharks (IPOA-Sharks) has fostered international
cooperation, with the greatest advancements observed in areas beyond national jurisdic-
tions (ABNJ), fisheries managed by RFMOs and nations with strong monitoring systems.
Complementary international agreements such as the Convention on International Trade
in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and the Convention on the
Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) have strengthened protec-
tions. Notably, all sawfish (Pristidae) are listed under CITES Appendix I, and species
like the oceanic whitetip shark, hammerheads (Sphyrna spp.), silky shark, manta rays
(Rajiformes), wedgefishes (Rhynchobatus spp.), giant guitarfishes (Rhinobatos spp.) and
the shortfin mako have been added to Appendix II. CITES continue to play a central role
in regulating trade and promoting sustainable management of sharks.

         carried out by the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM), which has been providing information on stock
         status in Area 37 since 2008 within its report on the State of the Mediterranean and Black Sea Fisheries (FAO, 2023). The GFCM
         estimate for 2021 is 42 percent of stocks at biologically sustainable levels, nearly double what was reported in 2012 (22 percent).

3. PROGESS TOWARDS ACHIEVING GLOBAL OBJECTIVES

3.1 Prospects of achieving the Sustainable Development Goal target
on fisheries
Under the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 14 (SDG 14), FAO is mandated
to monitor global progress toward the sustainable use of fishery resources. SDG 14
(Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable devel-
opment) includes Target 14.4 aimed at ending overfishing by 2020.
    In 2021, 64.5 percent of the stocks of the world’s marine fisheries were fished within
biologically sustainable levels. The continuously decreasing global trend in the propor-
tion of sustainably fished stocks (FIGURE C.2) is a cause for concern in the international
community. Urgent concrete rebuilding plans and management efforts are needed to
achieve sustainable fisheries. However, there are also positive signals in the assessment
from some regions of the world like the North Atlantic, Northeast Pacific and Southeast
Pacific, which demonstrate that effective fisheries management can make an impact and
enhance fisheries sustainability. In other parts of the world, change is underway, for exam-
ple in Southeast Asia, fisheries management is improving, particularly in Thailand where
effort controls and a buyback programme are being implemented. Similarly, Indonesia
is working to reduce its total allowable catch (TAC) and fishing effort across its waters.
In West Africa, management is also progressing, especially in the Gulf of Guinea and
the Benguela Current Commission (BCC) region. However, some fish stocks remain
significantly overfished in certain areas. Unfortunately, the pace of these improvements
remains slower than the timeline required to meet the SDGs.
    Recent studies show that intensively managed stocks have seen, on average, their
abundance increasing or stabilising at or around target levels; while in contrast, regions
with less developed fisheries management tend to have excessively higher harvest rates,
and consequently stocks with lower abundance and sustainability with regards to target
levels (Hilborn et al., 2020). This underscores the urgent need to replicate and adapt
successful policies and regulations in fisheries in regions where effective management
is lacking, while also developing innovative mechanisms to promote sustainable use of
marine resources globally. These efforts align with FAO’s Blue Transformation objective
of bringing 100 percent of fisheries under effective management (FAO, 2022).
    Overfishing not only reduces the supply of aquatic animals for human consumption
but negatively impacts biodiversity and ecosystem functions, leading to adverse social,
cultural and economic consequences. Ye et al. (2013) showed that rebuilding overfished
stocks to the biomass that enables them to deliver maximum sustainable yield (MSY)
could increase fisheries production globally by 16.5 million tonnes and annual revenues
by USD 32 billion. Other studies estimated that poor fisheries management results in
foregone revenues of more than USD 83 billion annually due to overfishing (World Bank,
2017). In addition, overfishing and underfishing in many regions of the world exacerbate
food insecurity and undermine livelihoods (Hilborn et al., 2025). Better management
would also significantly increase the contribution of marine fisheries to the food security,
nutrition, economic development and well-being of coastal communities.
3.2 Food security implications
In FAO’s current approach, the term “maximally sustainably fished” typically refers to
stocks that are, on average, maintained at 40–60 percent of their unfished biomass level
(B0). BMSY is estimated as a percent of their unfished biomass level, because BMSY is usually
40–60 percent of B0. The default value for BMSY is 50 percent of B0. In this context, FAO
considers stocks above 60 percent of the unfished biomass to be classified as underfished,
and those under 40 percent as overfished (PART B, METHODOLOGY, pp. 6). This definition
originated from the concept of surplus production of fish stocks, and assumes that MSY is
the goal of fishery management (UN, 1982, 1995; FAO, 1995).
C   58                                                                                             Review of the state of world marine fishery resources




            However, the biomass associated with MSY (BMSY) varies due to species differences,
         data uncertainties and model selection – and, from year to year, with local climatic condi-
         tions. While there is no global consensus on what sustainable fisheries targets should be
         or precise estimates of suitable thresholds for defining status of stocks and associated
         reference points, it is clear that single species BMSY may lie within a range of such values
         (Hilborn, 2010).
            The global cumulative distribution function (CDF) of 2 570 stocks (FIGURE C.23) illus-
         trates the impact of considering different biomass reference points on the perception
         of overfishing. MSY normally tends to occur at or around 50 percent BMSY assuming
         a Schaeffer production function. Selection of more stringent criteria for sustainability
         increases the proportion of stocks classed as being overfished. Based on the FAO approach
         where the reference point is 40 percent of B 0 , equivalent to 80 percent of BMSY, and gives
         35 percent of stocks as being overfished.
            However, if we use BMSY (0.5 B 0) as the threshold, the proportion of overfished stocks
         increases to 59.7 percent. Further tightening the target with a threshold at 0.6 B 0 or
         1.2 BMSY results in an estimated 81.8 percent of stocks being overfished. Note that the 80
         to 120 percent buffer on BMSY was designed to deal with uncertainty in BMSY in general
         and relative to B 0 .

           The blue curve represents a theoretical distribution aligned with SDG Target 14.4,
         which calls for 100 percent of fish stocks to be above the BMSY target (implied here to
         be over 0.4 B0 accounting for uncertaintyin the estimates of BMSY). The persistent and
         widening gap between the observed distribution and this target indicates that achiev-
         ing SDG 14.4 by 2030 is increasingly unlikely. This reflects a core challenge as the target
         may not be realistically attainable in all regions, and failure to meet it could have serious

implications for global food security, particularly in vulnerable coastal areas with limited
fisheries management capacity. There have been notable local management successes, but
overall progress remains insufficient and without decisive and coordinated action the gap
is likely to persist. Addressing this issue will require significant investment and bold policy
interventions to avoid potentially severe social, economic and ecological consequences.
    Moreover, in a natural system characterized by high process variability and imperfect
management, maintaining fish stocks at overly precautionary levels (effectively shifting the
population toward the right-hand side of the CDF) may unitentionally constrain fishery
yield. This approach implicitly interacts with the underlying production function, where
yield is not necessarily maximized at biomass levels approaching B 0 (the unfished or carry-
ing capacity). Consequently, such a conservative strategy may lead to suboptimal harvest
outcomes, particularly when biomass levels exceed those associated with maximum sustain-
able yield BMSY. As illustrated by the blue curve, such an approach could reduce overall
fish production, thereby increasing food insecurity, and thus hampering FAO efforts and
policies to reduce malnutrition and food insecurity.

4. GENERAL METHODOLOGICAL NOTES
The updated analysis adopts a more comprehensive and participatory approach than in
previous editions, providing a more accurate representation of the state of the fish stocks
at global and regional level while matching the resolution used by local fisheries managers.
It took over two years to compile the data and analysis for 2 570 stocks, and involved 19
Area-based workshops and consultations with around 650 experts from all regions.
   The approach followed is evidence-based, transparent and participatory. It was designed
to build regional capacity, and its consultative in-depth regional peer-review process is
endorsed by regional experts. While for several Areas there are rigorous assessment reports
for all major exploited stocks, the updated approach expands coverage, enabling the state of
the stocks classification where local data and capacity for full stock assessment is limited.
In cases where good-quality catch and effort data was available, local or area-based assess-
ments using surplus production models were performed. And where it was not possible to
run model-based stock assessments, alternative methods that synthesize a variety of quan-
titative and qualitative knowledge were employed.
   While the resolution at the stock level has increased almost five-fold across all regions, it
has increased almost tenfold in data-limited regions of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. This
higher resolution will enable improved (in terms of signal vs. noise) monitoring of stocks
in the FAO Major Fishing Areas (Areas 31, 34, 41, 51, 57, 61, 71, 77 and 87) that are domi-
nated by multi-species and multi-gear small-scale fisheries, for which species-specific data
(quantity and quality) and knowledge are limited. The quality of any analysis is inherently
dependent on the accuracy and completeness of the underlying data and knowledge – an
ongoing challenge for both data-rich and data-poor stocks.
   This update marks a significant improvement in the resolution of the global status of
fishery stocks and enhances the previous methodology, particularly in relation to stand-
ardization, while also introducing new challenges. For example, if the updated baseline
for stocks becomes saturated with small pelagic species that tend to be more resilient, the
overall overfishing estimate would present an overoptimistic view (Area 57, for exam-
ple). Similarly, less-resilient groups may be overlooked because they have already been
depleted and have lower chances of being assessed due to a lack of information. Often,
these groups may be aggregated (for example, sharks and rays) and hence have less influ-
ence by number on estimating an overfishing index when compared to stocks of more
resilient and productive species subjected to intense monitoring. In addition, some small
stocks that are often targeted by small-scale fisheries might not be considered important
in terms of fish production, but are critically important for food and nutrition security
and livelihoods for coastal communities (FAO, Duke and Worldfish, 2023; Basurto et al.,
2025). The need to counterbalance this tendency and increase the resolution of less-pro-
ductive species and smaller stocks in the index will be a high priority in the future, and
will require additional resources.

         HIGHLY MIGRATORY TUNAS
         Tunas are generally more productive than other species, and so estimated BMSY values tend
         to be much lower than the traditional expectation of 50 percent of unfished biomass (B 0)
         (Maunder and Deriso, 2013). Some tuna stocks may be most productive when reduced to
         a quarter of their unfished stock size, i.e. their BMSY is 25 percent of B 0 . Such stocks would,
         under the circumstances, only be considered overfished under the FAO classification (80
         percent of BMSY) if reduced to less than a fifth of their original stock level (B0) or 20 percent
         of B 0 .

         HIGHLY MIGRATORY SHARKS
         In previous assessments, this group was not assessed as a separate group. Progress
         in species-specific data collection and reporting has significantly improved scientific
         research, bycatch mitigation, and stock assessments for several shark species, including
         blue shark (Prionace glauca), silky shark (Carcharhinus falciformis) and oceanic whitetip
         shark (Carcharhinus longimanus) (Rice and Harley, 2012, 2013; Rice et al., 2013; Rice
         and Sharma, 2015).

         AREA 27
         In Area 27, the B trigger (Btrig) and B precautionary (Bpa) reference points used for manage-
         ment are substantially lower than BMSY (ICES, 2022). This may contribute to an overly
         optimistic perception of stock status in Area 27, particularly in comparison to other FAO
         Areas where assessments were based on the more precautionary benchmark of 80 percent of
         BMSY. 1 The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) is considering this
         issue within its Working Groups, and modifications to the assessment approach might be
         reflected in subsequent analysis. However, for consistency purposes, this report retains the
         original approach, as Btrig and Bpa were also used as the basis for the previous FAO assessments.
         Area 27 stock resolution went from 34 species groupings to 178 stocks assessed, from the
         235 monitored by ICES. The remaining 57 stocks may be added in future iterations.

         AREA 51
         In Area 51, there are 32 countries and commissions, and some like the Regional Commission
         for Fisheries (RECOFI) as well as India and Pakistan, reported a substantial number of
         new stocks, contributing to a significant increase of the overall coverage. The number of
         stocks assessed in this region increased from 32 species groupings in previous assessments to
         470 disaggregated stock in 2021. In addition to the estimate of sustainability for this Area
         (reported in section 2.2 in this chapter), an alternative estimate could be generated that
         weighs the assessments according to they tiers (i.e. Tier 1 has twice the weight of Tier 2, and
         Tier 2 has twice the weight of Tier 3). In addition, the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission
         (IOTC) regularly updates the status of tuna and tuna-like species, while the Southwest
         Indian Ocean Fisheries Commission (SWIOFC) strives to assess the other main regional
         stocks in areas beyond national jurisdiction using data-poor methods.

         AREA 57
         In Area 57, the number of stocks assessed has increased from 52 species groupings in previ-
         ous assessments to 308 disaggregated stocks in 2021. The region’s assessment substantially
         improved the coverage from the Bay of Bengal countries that were missing in the past. For
         the first time, some species were assessed with models more reliable than the catch-only
         models and trend-based approaches used in the past. In addition, there has been a substan-
         tial increase in smaller units and stocks of cultural and socioeconomic importance as part of

         1
             ICES uses Bpa as the reference point for management, considering it as a proxy for BMSY. However, an analysis
             performed by Winker and Cardinale (ICES, 2022) demonstrates this is more akin to Blim.
PART C ■ Global overview                                                                           61




the new baseline, giving a better, more relevant picture of resources than before. However,
one of the limitations of this update is that species that are currently assessed appear to be
in a better state than the less-resilient species that are no longer seen in the landings or are
no longer assessed due to some stocks having declined to levels below commercial interest
or collapsing entirely – and are hence missing from the FAO index. Similar to Area 51
and to deal with the challenges identified for Area 57, a weighted estimate by tier could be
produced using the same methodology as for Area 51.

AREA 61
In Area 61, 63.0 percent of assessed stocks were within biologically sustainable levels
in 2021. This differs from the previously used approach that reported 44.0 percent as
sustainable in 2021. The most likely reason for this difference is the increase in assessed
species, rising from 25 aggregate species in previous assessments to 92 disaggregated stocks
in 2021. A significant portion of these stocks came from the Republic of Korea, China
and the Russian Federation, where their status was, on average, better than in previous
aggregated assessments for the region. In addition to the estimate of sustainability for this
Area (reported in section 2.3 in this chapter), an alternative estimate was generated that
weighs the assessments according to they tiers (i.e. Tier 1 has twice the weight of Tier 2,
and Tier 2 has twice the weight of Tier 3).

AREA 67
In Area 67, two separate indices to assess the status of the stocks were produced (one
accounting for salmon stocks and another one without them) to assess the overall dynamics
in this region. Previous estimates only assessed Pacific salmon at species level not stock
level. Now, there are 85 salmon-specific assessments and 110 other assessments, and a total
of 195 assessments in 2021 from the region. With salmon included in the calculations,
82 percent of stocks were classified as sustainable in 2021, as compared to 76.5 percent
under the previous approach using the same reference year, which assessed only 34 aggre-
gated species/stocks. However, if salmon is assessed separately as a group, 67.1 percent of
salmon stocks were classified as biologically sustainable in 2021, while 92.7 percent of the
remaining non-salmon stocks were sustainable in 2021, presenting a significantly different
perspective on this region. This positive performance of stocks other than salmon can be
attributed to the policy of prioritizing stability over maximum yield in Alaska pollock.
By maintaining a consistent total allowable catch (TAC), associated species within the
pollock-centered fishery are managed at biomass levels well above their BMSY, contributing
to overall sustainability.

AREA 71
In Area 71, under the updated approach, 52.9 percent of stocks were classified as sustainable
in 2021, compared to 65.2 percent under the previous methodology for the same year. This
decrease is likely attributable to the use of more robust baseline information for assessed
stocks, along with a more detailed and rigorous examination of stock status. The updated
approach assessed 263 stocks in 2021 whereas the previous method relied on catch trends to
categorize 46 species groups. In addition, the updated approach now includes a considerable
number of stocks from the Pacific islands and Southeast Asian countries, assessed using
Tier 3 approaches, thereby enhancing the information base for this region. In 2021, over
80 percent of the Tier 1 stocks in this region were sustainable, whereas the figures are 30
percent and 50 percent for Tiers 2 and 3, respectively. The decline can thus be attributed
to smaller, non-assessed stocks that were excluded from the previous analysis.

         AREA 77
         In Area 77, estimates suggest that approximately 69.2 percent of the stocks were harvested at
         biologically sustainable levels in 2021, compared to 84.2 percent under the previous approach
         with the same reference year. Notably, this is likely due to the increased resolution for this region,
         with the number of assessed groups rising from 19 to 91 disaggregated stocks from Central
         America. Importantly, stocks of California sardine (Sardinops caeruleus), anchovy (Engaulis
         mordax), Pacific anchoveta (Cetengraulis mysticetus), Pacific thread herring (Opisthonema
         libertate) and jumbo flying squid (Dosidicus gigas) were currently assessed as being at biolog-
         ically sustainable levels in 2021. However, coastal resources of high-value species, including
         groupers, snappers and shrimps, were still overfished in 2021. These coastal resources are now
         a substantial part of the baseline compared to the previous analysis.

         AREA 81
         In Area 81, under the updated approach, about 85.5 percent of assessed fishery stocks in the
         Southwest Pacific were at biologically sustainable levels in 2021, compared to 75.9 percent
         for the same year with the previous approach. This difference is primarily due to the fact
         that Australia and New Zealand included 165 stocks, compared to the previous approach
         which used only 29 species or stock groups.

         AREA 87
         In Area 87, although the majority of the landings were from stocks at biologically sustain-
         able levels (approximately 81 percent, because of Peruvian anchoveta [Engraulis ringens]),
         just 46.4 percent of the assessed stocks in the Area were within sustainable levels in 2021,
         compared to 33.3 percent using the previous approach. Stock resolution improved from 12
         species aggregates to 97 disaggregated stocks/species.

         OTHER AREAS

         AREAS 21, 31, 34, 37, 41 AND 47
         Areas 21, 31, 34, 37, 41 and 47 have not been discussed under separate headings in this
         section as the differences in 2021 under the updated assessment and previous approaches are
         relatively minor. However, in each of these Areas, the updated methodology has increased
         the resolution of assessments by assessing more disaggregated stocks.
            In AREA 21, the number of stocks increased from 42 aggregated species groups in previous
         assessments to 150 disaggregated stocks in 2021. The estimated proportion of biologically
         sustainable shock changed slightly, from 64.3 percent with the previous methodology to
         63.3 percent with the updated methodology for the same reference year.
            In AREA 31, the number of stocks increased from 50 aggregated species groups in previ-
         ous assessments to 103 disaggregated stocks in 2021, with biologically sustainable stocks
         increasing from 58.0 percent under the previous methodology to 62.1 percent using the
         updated methodology for the same year.
            In AREA 34 , the number of stocks increased from 39 aggregated species groups in previ-
         ous assessments to 133 disaggregated stocks in 2021, while the proportion of biologically
         sustainable stocks declined slightly from 48.7 percent with the previous methodology to
         47.4 percent with the updated methodology for the same year. In addition to the estimate of
         sustainability for this Area (reported in section 2.1 in this chapter), an alternative estimate
         could be generated that weighs the assessments according to they tiers (i.e. Tier 1 has twice
         the weight of Tier 2, and Tier 2 has twice the weight of Tier 3). This weighted estimate by
         tier for Area 34 is 51.0 percent.

   In AREA 37, the number of stocks increased from 40 aggregated species groups in previous assess-
ments to 114 disaggregated stocks in 2021, with a decline in biologically sustainable stocks from
37.5 percent with the previous methodology to 35.1 percent with the updated methodology for the
same reference year.
   In AREA 41 the number of assessment units increased from 17 species groups in previous assess-
ments to 69 disaggregated stocks in 2021, with a slight decrease in biologically sustainable stocks
from 58.8 percent with the previous methodology to 58.0 percent with the updated methodology
for the same year. In addition to the estimate of sustainability for this Area (reported in section 2.1
in this chapter), an alternative estimate could be generated at the request of the countries that weighs
the assessments according to they tiers (i.e. Tier 1 has twice the weight of Tier 2, and Tier 2 has twice
the weight of Tier 3).
   In AREA 47, the number of stocks increased from 37 species groups in previous assessments to
81 disaggregated stocks in 2021, with the proportion of biologically sustainable stocks decreasing from
59.5 with the previous methodology to 58.0 percent with the updated methodology for the same year.

AREAS 48, 58 AND 88
Finally, AREAS 48, 58 AND 88 , which have not been reported in previous assessments, were included
for the first time, and all the 15 stocks assessed in these Areas were found to be at biologically
sustainable levels in 2021.

NORTHWEST ATLANTIC
FAO MAJOR FISHING AREA 21

Paul A. Medley
Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations


1. OVERVIEW
The Northwest Atlantic, designated by FAO as Major Fishing Area 21 (hereafter, Area 21),
extends from Cape Hatteras in North Carolina in the south, to Baffin Bay, between
Canada and Greenland, in the north (FIGURE D.1.1). It covers a total surface area of about
6.5 million km2 and encompasses the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of Canada,
Greenland, Saint Pierre et Miquelon (France), and the United States of America (hereafter,
the United States). The continental shelf is wide in this region. Nutrients primarily come
from offshore slope waters, which mix with shelf waters, boosting primary production.

                             The West Greenland Current moves Atlantic waters into the Arctic, then down into
                          the Labrador Sea and back, carrying cold water south. Further south, the Gulf Stream
Northwest Atlantic




                          carries warm water from the Gulf of Mexico passing as close as 30 km from the shore off
                          Cape Hatteras before moving east to form the North Atlantic Current. On Greenland’s
                          west coast, cold waters flow from the north while the warmer Irminger Current, branch-
                          ing from the North Atlantic Current, cycles round to join the Labrador Current off the
                          southern tip of Greenland. Melting freshwater from Greenland’s ice sheet contributes to
                          rising sea levels – a growing concern with global climate change.
                             Climate change predictions suggest that the Northwest Atlantic Shelf is one of the
                          fastest-warming ocean areas globally. A shift in warm, saline currents in 2009–2010
                          impeded the volume of oxygen-rich waters from the Labrador Current reaching the shelf
                          (Gonçalves Neto, Langan and Palter, 2021), likely having a significant impact on fishery
                          productivity and species distribution. Climate change is posing increasing risks to fisher-
                          ies and fishing communities through warming water, rising sea levels, and meteorological
                          changes such as more frequent and severe storms. The possible secondary impacts include
                          changes in species movements leading to longer fishing trips and higher costs.
                             Area 21 has a long history of Indigenous fisheries dating back millenia; these remain
                          important, particularly in Canada and Greenland. Alongside coastal shellfish and
                          groundfish, Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), in particular, plays a vital role in the culture
                          of coastal communities. Harvests vary significantly across the region, with communities
                          in colder climates historically being more dependent on marine mammals. Industrial
                          fisheries in this Area began early, with distant-water fleets targeting cod fishing grounds
                          since the sixteenth century (Lear, 1998). Initially, the fishery exploited Atlantic cod
                          (Gadus morhua) almost exclusively, but later expanded to other groundfish and pelagic
                          species. Catches in Area 21 had two sharp declines in the mid-1970s and in the early
                          1990s (FIGURE D.1.2), primarily driven by declines in stock sizes of groundfish and some
                          pelagics. Recreational fisheries are also important in this region.
                             Important stocks, including Atlantic cod, white hake (Urophycis tenuis), haddock
                          (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) and silver hake (Merluccius bilinearis), remain depleted, with
                          landings at about 0.1 million tonnes since the late 1990s – only 5 percent of their histori-
                          cal peak in 1965. Environmentally driven productivity changes have likely contributed to
                          the slow recovery of some stocks, such as Atlantic cod, American plaice (Hippoglossoides
                          platessoides), winter flounder (Pseudopleuronectes americanus) and yellowtail flounder
                          (Limanda ferruginea). In contrast, invertebrate stocks have generally fared better and
                          continue to support major fisheries. In 2021, the Northwest Atlantic produced around
                          1.6 million tonnes of fisheries landings, down from a peak of about 4.6 million tonnes
                          in 1968.
                             Several conservation organizations were set up to recover and sustain the vital fish
                          and shellfish stocks in the area. The North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization
                          (NASCO) was established to prioritize the slowing of the decline of salmon stocks and
                          the rebuilding of wild populations to sustainable levels. The Northwest Atlantic Fisheries
                          Organization (NAFO) is an intergovernmental fisheries science and management body
                          set up to oversee the long-term sustainability and conservation of the fishery resources in
                          the NAFO regulatory area, which covers 2.7 million km2 of Area 21. The organization
                          regulates the fisheries of several species including shrimp, groundfish and pelagic redfish
                          and includes the United States, Canada and Greenland. There is currently a moratorium
                          on the fisheries of pelagic redfish and shrimp.

2. FISHERY PROFILES

2.1 The United States of America
Currently, the most valuable fisheries for the United States in Area 21 include mixed-spe-
cies groundfish, American lobster (Homarus americanus) and American sea scallop
(Placopecten magellanicus). Modern fisheries utilize various fishing gears, such as otter
trawls for mixed groundfish and flatfish, dredges for American sea scallops, and pots for
lobsters. New Bedford, Massachusetts, boasts the highest value of catch landings in the
United States, with 52 000 tonnes valued at USD 376.6 million, of which sea scallops
account for 84 percent of the value and 26 percent of the volume (NMFS, 2022). Other
valuable crustaceans and bivalve molluscs include Atlantic surfclams (Spisula solidissima)
and ocean quahogs (Arctica islandica), which are federally managed; and blue crabs
(Callinectes sapidus), oysters, blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) and Northern quahog (also
known as hard clams, Mercenaria mercenaria), which are managed by individual states
in inshore waters.
   Principal groundfish and flounders in the northeast United States, particularly cod,
haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) and yellowtail flounder (Limanda ferruginea), were
previously overfished, reaching record low spawning stock biomass levels in 1993–94,
but have been increasing towards target levels in recent years. Dogfish and skates, which
increased in abundance as groundfish and flounders declined in the 1970s, now consti-
tute a substantial fraction of fish biomass on Georges Bank.
   Most fisheries in the northeast region of the United States are governed through fishery
management plans (FMPs), as required by the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation
and Management Act. Overexploitation of some species has continued to occur despite
the introduction of FMPs, and subsequent efforts to rebuild have generally not fully
restored all depleted stocks. The most common fishing controls are catch limits, but
other measures are taken where appropriate (e.g. limiting days at sea, imposing morato-
ria on new entrants, and gear requirements). Closures of portions of Georges Bank since
December 1994 have supported the recovery and protection of both scallops and ground-
fish. Currently, the United States also works with the NAFO to coordinate management
of fisheries resources shared with other nations.
   Recreational fishing has grown significantly in Area 21, and now contributes greatly
to tourism and leisure activities in coastal areas of the northeast United States, as well as
on inland lakes and rivers. These fisheries primarily use rod-and-line. The United States
reports the highest recreational landings in Area 21, where they form a substantial part
of the catch in some fisheries. For example, recreational catches of bluefish (Pomatomus
saltatrix) have considerably exceeded commercial catches since 1985, and recreational
catches were the main factor limiting the speed of rebuilding from their low point in
2018. Due to its significance, recreational fishing is regulated through licensing, bag limits
and size restrictions. Conservation organizations and anglers promote catch-and-release
practices to reduce fishing pressure, though catching to eat still constitutes a considerable
part of recreational fishing activity.
   Finally, fishing by Indigenous communities has been taking place along the Northwest
Atlantic coast for millennia. Although it does not represent a significant proportion of
landings today, a renewed interest in Indigenous practices, alongside modern scientific
research into ecology, has broadened understanding of how to manage marine resources
and has led to changes in management principles (Reid et al., 2021).
2.2 Canada
Groundfish have historically dominated the eastern Canadian fishing industry. From
1950 to 1990, cod, Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), redfishes (Sebastes spp.), American
plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides), American sea scallop and haddock saw the largest
landings. The cod stocks subsequently collapsed and catches also declined for hake, wall-
eye pollock (also known as Alaska pollock, Gadus chalcogrammus), redfishes and flatfishes
since the early 1990s, with overall catches having reduced by more than 50 percent.

                             Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in the NAFO divisions in the Northwest Atlantic,
                          commonly known as Northern cod, was once one of the largest fisheries in the world.
Northwest Atlantic




                          However, in the early 1990s, the stock plummeted by over 90 percent and a morato-
                          rium on fishing for cod in Newfoundland and Labrador was imposed. This was officially
                          lifted in 2023, 32 years later. There was a 46 percent increase in permitted catch from
                          13 000 tonnes in 2022 to 18 000 tonnes in 2023, and the population was re-labelled as
                          being in the “cautious” zone following years of being classified as “critical”. Nonetheless,
                          the total allowable catch (TAC) remains very low compared to historical catches. The
                          effect of the moratorium on coastal communities has been immense: it put more than
                          30 000 people out of work, and ultimately led to a 10 percent decline in the province’s
                          population as young residents left to find work elsewhere (Schrank, 2005). The continued
                          recovery of the stock remains highly uncertain (DFO, 2024).
                             Currently, Canada has around 120 assessed stocks which support a range of fisheries,
                          including trawl fisheries for the iconic Atlantic cod and other groundfish and flatfish
                          stocks, as well as pot fisheries for shellfish such as American lobster and queen crab
                          (Chionoecetes opilio), and shrimp trawls for northern prawn (Pandalus borealis). Atlantic
                          herring is currently the largest pelagic fishery.
                             Indigenous populations in the maritime provinces of Canada have a long history of
                          fishing, particularly for cod and other sea life. Traditional practices include using weirs
                          and traps to catch fish in rivers and coastal waters (Castañeda et al., 2020). While tradi-
                          tional rights are recognized in Canada, progress towards integrating First Nations fishing
                          into national governance processes has been limited (Denny and Fanning, 2024). Today,
                          the Canadian cod TAC allocates 5 percent of the catch for Indigenous fisheries, which
                          represents about 15 tonnes.
                          2.3 Greenland
                          The Greenlandic economy is heavily dependent on fishing. With a population of only
                          56 500 people, Greenland has a rich history of fisheries and harvesting marine resources.
                          Hunting seals and other large animals was a major economic focus into the twentieth
                          century. However, declining markets for these products, increased human populations
                          and reduced seal populations led to a rise in the commercial finfish fishing industry. Cod
                          and halibut became increasingly important fisheries through Norwegian, British and
                          Portuguese vessels. Industrialization began in the 1950s, with the main focus being on
                          expanding the shrimp and cod fisheries (Rasmussen and Valdemarsvej, 2001).
                             Historically, fisheries included distant-water fleets using handlines, longlines or trawls
                          to target cod and take the majority of the catch (Horsted, 2000). Today, fisheries are
                          predominantly conducted by domestic fleets. Denmark heavily invested in the fishing
                          industry, particularly in the cod fishery, which collapsed in the late 1980s due in part to
                          inadequate management response to environmental changes. Moratoria were imposed
                          on major groundfish fisheries in the early 1990s to facilitate stock rebuilding, which also
                          had an associated impact on the economy. The cod catch limits have now returned to
                          historical levels (ICES, 2022).
                             The most important current domestic Greenlandic fisheries are offshore trawl fisheries
                          for northern prawn, Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), Atlantic cod and
                          redfish, and inshore gillnet fisheries for Greenland halibut, cod and lumpfish (Cyclopterus
                          lumpus). In 2021, total landings were around 171 000 tonnes. Offshore vessels have been
                          consolidated to a fleet of around 25 larger industrial vessels able to fish for prawns, ground-
                          fish and pelagics. Many of the inshore fleet of around 2 000 active vessels are small open
                          boats operating at subsistence levels. Inshore fisheries mainly occur in the coastal waters of
                          western Greenland rather than off the more exposed east coast. The Greenland Fisheries
                          Act requires at least 25 percent of domestic offshore shrimp and Greenland halibut to be
                          landed in Greenland for processing (Cappell and Macfadyen, 2019).
                             Other species harvested include salmon, catfish, chars, Greenland cod (Gadus ogac),
                          Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus), capelin (Mallotus villosus), Greenland
                          shark (Somniosus microcephalus), Iceland scallop (Chlamys islandica) and snow crab
                          (Chionoecetes opilio). Indigenous seal hunting and whaling are also carried out, and fishing

by Indigenous and local communities continues to be important in Greenland. All fishing
and hunting are limited by catch numbers and regulations to sustain target populations.

3. RESOURCE STATUS

3.1 Reference list of stocks
This report uses a reference list of stocks which comprises 150 assessment units, covering 57
different species (TABLE D.1.1 and APPENDIX II, TABLE 1, pp. 415). These cover a very wide range
of fisheries and stocks, reflecting the diverse nature of Area 21 fisheries. Under the previous
methodology, only 42 stocks were assessed; these largely corresponded to species and
species groups rather than fish stocks, although the evaluation was still based on individual
stock assessments. For example, the status of American lobster (Homarus americanus) was
reported as a single unit but now it is reported based on separately managed areas. This gives
a much more comprehensive measure of status across these fisheries. Nonetheless, under
the updated methodology used in this report, some stocks are still reported in groups (e.g.
redfish [Sebastes spp.]). This can be due to a variety of reasons, such as reported catches
not being separated, or populations being poorly defined and thus stocks being managed
together. All stocks may be combined or further separated in the future based on scientific
research and as the understanding of the biology and ecology of these populations improves.

3.2 Classification of the status of stocks
3.2.1 METHODOLOGY
The United States has a requirement to monitor status relative to maximum sustainable
yield (MSY), and therefore reference points are couched in these terms. The determination
is usually based on integrated stock assessment models that incorporate a stock–recruit-
ment relationship as a paradigm rather than a function fitted empirically. This approach
allows estimation of the stock size compared to an unexploited state even where that state
is not observed. Because recruitment, and hence productivity, are affected by climate
change, assessments may only use recent recruitments to reflect the current state. Given
expected recruitment, stock status can then be reported as a ratio compared to an estimate
of unexploited spawning stock biomass (SSB 0), and interpreted relative to 32 percent
SSB 0 , below which a stock is overexploited, and 48 percent SSB 0 , over which it is not fully
exploited, assuming 40 percent SSB 0 is a reasonable proxy for MSY. So, a stock is maxi-
mally sustainably harvested with spawning biomass between 80 percent and 120 percent
of the MSY level. For some stocks that are considered more productive, a 35 percent SSB0
21                   74                                                           Review of the state of world marine fishery resources



                          MSY proxy may be used. In other cases, a stock–recruitment relationship can be estimated
                          that a scientific working group considers reliable enough to use to estimate biomass for
Northwest Atlantic




                          MSY (BMSY), so this can be used directly in the same way.
                              While evaluating stock status relative to BMSY is recognized as most desirable, in many
                          cases this direct evaluation is not possible and there is only an evaluation relative to fish-
                          ing mortality at MSY (F/FMSY) or an accepted biomass limit. This is often due to the lack
                          of information that would allow an acceptable BMSY reference point to be established.
                          Where there is only a fishing mortality estimate, values for F/FMSY of less than 50 percent
                          are considered underfished and of more than 100 percent overfished for the purposes of
                          this report. Where only a biomass limit reference point is available, any biomass below
                          the limit is considered overfished, while it is considered underfished if it is above three
                          times the limit.
                              In Canada, the approach used is a little different. A precautionary risk-based method
                          is applied, which sets a limit reference point (LRP) and an upper stock reference (USR)
                          point that define three zones along the abundance or biomass axis. A risk-based approach
                          allows the inclusion of other information besides the strict stock assessment results. A
                          stock below the LRP might be considered at high risk of recruitment overfishing. If a
                          stock is in this critical zone, it is considered overfished for this report. Using this method
                          in determining when a stock is not fully exploited is more difficult. The zone between
                          the LRP and USR is the “cautious” zone, and effectively indicates a trigger point when
                          management action may be required to avoid the stock falling below the LRP. As a result,
                          it does not indicate that a stock is less than fully exploited. Unless there is specific evidence
                          otherwise, in this report stocks were assumed to be maximally sustainably fished rather
                          than underfished. This is often supported by observing that many stocks are below or
                          close to the USR or have dipped below the USR in the recent past.
                              A few stocks in Canada are managed through advice from the International Council
                          for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) and from NAFO. ICES applies its own approach
                          (PART B, METHODOLOGY, pp. 6) that is similar to the Canadian approach described above,
                          but, where possible, it is linked to explicit MSY references. However, ICES does not gener-
                          ally reference unexploited biomass states when determining status as it does not rely on
                          default stock–recruitment relationships. Where NAFO is dealing with stocks solely in
                          international waters, they are data-limited and the advice is quite general; it still indicates
                          stock status, but with higher uncertainty.
                              For the purposes of this evaluation, integrated stock assessments and index-based
                          assessments that have well-defined reference points were both treated as having low uncer-
                          tainty. The index-based methods are in general more uncertain than integrated models as
                          they depend on fewer sources of information on stock state. The United States fisheries
                          advice has often adopted an index-based approach where the integrated model has been
                          rejected in the independent review process. Index-based methods are often difficult to
                          evaluate and include more untestable assumptions, so will tend to underestimate uncer-
                          tainty. However, in some cases, particularly for sedentary shellfish, a survey can obtain
                          a reasonable precautionary absolute abundance estimate and can be used to recommend
                          harvest level. In general, other index-based methods have been broadly evaluated, and well
                          evaluated in specific cases, such that they have been shown to be robust in the manage-
                          ment context. Therefore, these differences in uncertainty are not sufficiently far apart to
                          warrant different classification within the broad determinations in this review.
                          3.2.2 STOCK STATUS AND CLASSIFICATION BY TIER
                          An estimated 63.3 percent of stocks are considered sustainably fished in Area 21, represent-
                          ing 52.7 percent maximally sustainably fished and 10.7 percent underfished (TABLE D.1.2).
                          When weighted by landings, the percentage of sustainable stocks increases to 84.6 percent,
                          indicating that larger stocks are overall more sustainable (TABLE D.1.3). Most of the stocks
                          in Area 21 are considered Tier 1 assessments according to the updated FAO methodology.
                          However, it is important to note that, of the 148 Tier 1 stocks, the associated uncertainty
                          is higher for 58 stocks which use biomass dynamic model approaches.

4. KEY SELECTED SPECIES AND GROUPS
This section identifies and discusses species and stocks that are currently most important
for Area 21 (FIGURE D.1.2).
4.1 Cods, hakes, haddocks
Area 21 has several separately assessed Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) stocks, which are
all subject to some management, although their status is not known precisely in all cases.
Index-based methods are used to apply harvest control rules aimed at maintaining high
yield in the longer term.
   The stock assessment model used to assess the abundance of Newfoundland/Labrador
Atlantic cod was updated in 2024 to include survey data of inshore and juvenile cod
starting in 1954, among other data (DFO, 2024). Recent stock assessment results suggest
that the productivity of the cod population was lower than previously thought, altering
expected population growth and yield. Northern cod productivity is linked to capelin
(Mallotus villosus) abundance, which collapsed in 1991. Capelin stock size is expected
to remain around 10 percent of pre-collapse levels in the short term, impeding cod stock
growth. Most of the cod stocks in Area 21 are still classified as overfished, and capelin
stocks are now maximally sustainably fished.
   Despite low catches, ecosystem conditions are such that there is overall low productivity,
including low levels of phytoplankton and zooplankton, and low abundance of key forage
species such as capelin and shrimp. These conditions have likely negatively impacted cod
productivity, so rebuilding has been very slow.

                                         Haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) and hake are in a similar situation to cod,
                                      whereas silver hake (Merluccius bilinearis) has probably recovered as exploitation was
Northwest Atlantic




                                      reduced. These stocks have benefited from the reduction in fisheries targeting cod because
                                      they are caught at the same time. Overall, the majority of haddock and hake stocks are
                                      overfished, with silver hake sustainably fished.
                                         There is currently no directed fishery for polar cod (Boreogadus saida), which is consid-
                                      ered an important prey species in the Arctic marine ecosystem and is likely to be affected
                                      by climate change. Under the ecosystem approach to management, a fishery on this species
                                      may require biomass reference points rather than the default alternatives.
                                      4.2 Herrings, sardines, anchovies
                                      The main species in ISSCAAP group 35 relevant to Area 21 is Atlantic herring (Clupea
                                      harengus). There are several spawning components of Atlantic herring grouped into
                                      management areas. Components are also split into spring or autumn spawners. Herring is
                                      predominantly found in Canadian waters. As with other fish stocks in Canadian Atlantic
                                      waters, recent environmental changes may have impacted stock productivity, so fishing
                                      mortality-based harvest strategies are put in place that adapt to changing recruitment.
                                      Overall, half of the stocks of herring in Area 21 are considered overfished and the other
                                      half are maximally sustainably fished.
                                         The large Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus) stock is caught along the entire
                                      East Coast of the United States, extending out of Area 31 into Area 21, with the main
                                      assessments for it included in the former.
                                      4.3 Lobsters, spiny rock lobsters
                                      Lobster landings in Area 21 are dominated by American lobster (Homarus americanus).
                                      Lobster fisheries are primarily managed by fishing effort limits, and by using local initi-
                                      atives such as “v-notching” where lobsters are released alive with a small notch in their
                                      tail based on various criteria (e.g. berried female or soft shelled). V-notched lobsters are
                                      discarded when caught again until the notch disappears, which occurs through moulting.

For the larger lobster coastal populations in the United States in Area 21, two manage-
ment units are assessed: the Maine stock and the New England stock. Overall, all lobsters
assessed in Area 21 were maximally sustainably fished.
4.4 Flounders, halibuts, soles
A significant expansion in the catches of flatfish occurred in the 1960s, followed by
a decline, particularly in American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides). However, in
international waters (NAFO Division 3M) the stock has probably now recovered to the
levels of the mid-1990s, when the fishery was closed; however, the fishery remains closed
for precautionary reasons. There is a similar mixed picture for witch (Glyptocephalus
cynoglossus), winter (Pseudopleuronectes americanus) and yellowtail (Limanda ferruginea)
flounders.
   Catches of American plaice, winter flounder and yellowtail flounder in Division 4T
(Southern Gulf of St. Lawrence) are very low, taken as bycatch in the fisheries directed
at witch flounder and Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides). Despite this,
the rebuilding prospects are low because of the current high level of natural mortality.
Therefore, although most of the stocks in this region are designated as overfished, it is
possible that the ecosystem has simply shifted to a new equilibrium and will not support
a fishery until the environmental situation changes.
   Catches have, to some extent, been compensated for by Greenland halibut, which
does not appear to be overexploited. However, the Gulf of St. Lawrence stock is in the
“cautious” zone, and its status is expected to worsen as environmental changes could lead
to negative effects on the productivity of Greenland halibut.
   Otherwise, the number of flatfish stocks being assessed has significantly increased.
These species are mostly caught in demersal trawls where they may not be a target, but
USA National Standards still requires that they are not overfished. In general, stock status
results are mixed and these stocks remain vulnerable to being overexploited as bycatch.
   Overall, stocks of flatfish in Area 21 are considered a mix of maximally sustainably
fished and overfished.
4.5 Scallops, pectens
Catches are dominated by American sea scallop (Placopecten magellanicus), although
significant catches are taken of Iceland scallop (Chlamys islandica) in some places. Scallops
are managed by areas. While adult scallops can move to some extent, they are effectively
sedentary once pelagic larvae have settled. It is likely that recruitment in different areas
is connected through the pelagic stage. The United States conducts a coastwide stock
assessment, whereas Canada tends to manage smaller areas and collects advice based on
those areas. In these different areas, Canada applies specific management regimes (e.g.
closed areas). Overall, scallop stocks in Area 21 are considered maximally sustainably
fished.
4.6 Clams, cockles, arkshells
Clam fisheries are conducted using dredges, including hydraulic dredges or hand
tools while diving or on foot, depending on availability, water depth and distribution.
Management is usually by area, some of which are quite small. There is a minimum landing
size, and a target harvest rate (proportion of area or stock size captured) and abundance
monitoring by catch per unit effort or survey, depending on the stock size. Catches are
usually reported as meat weight which is usually around 5–15 percent of the live weight
depending on species, season and age. The meat quantities are relatively small compared
to finfish landings. Landings in this group are marked by a particularly rapid expansion in
landings of ocean quahog (Arctica islandica) in the late 1970s. This is a long-lived species,
with low natural mortality and hence vulnerable to overexploitation. Nonetheless, clam
stocks in Area 21 are currently considered maximally sustainably fished.

                          5. KEY FINDINGS
Northwest Atlantic




                          Fisheries in Area 21 are highly developed and diverse, with significant catches dating
                          back centuries. Mechanized trawls have been in operation for many decades, and the
                          resources experienced extreme fishing pressures in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Since
                          then, countries have decreased fishing pressure, allowing many stocks to rebuild. However,
                          rebuilding has been hampered due to significant changes in productivity of some stocks,
                          such as Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides),
                          and yellowtail flounder (Limanda ferruginea) in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, which has
                          been linked to environmental effects. Although catches may be very low, so that over-
                          fishing is not occurring, these stocks are still considered overfished because they have not
                          recovered to past levels due to low recruitment and high natural mortality. In general, the
                          invertebrate fisheries are in a better state than finfish fisheries, where the abundance of
                          American lobster (Homarus americanus), for example, is generally increasing in contrast
                          to many finfish resources.
                             Most stocks in the Northwest Atlantic obtain their scientific advice from the United
                          States or Canadian scientific authorities, although a few West Greenland stocks obtain
                          ICES advice. There is some cooperation between Canada and the United States over
                          shared stocks. Stocks are generally assessed on a regular 1–5-year cycle, with the more
                          frequent assessments reserved for high-pressure stocks. Out of the 150 assessed stocks,
                          63.3 percent are sustainably fished, with 10.7 percent estimated to be underfished and
                          52.7 maximally sustainably fished.
                             When comparing the previous and current methodology, the portion of sustain-
                          ably fished stocks and of stocks in each category of exploitation remains very similar
                          (TABLE D.1.4). This indicates that the coverage in the previous analysis was already quite
                          extensive, even though granularity has nonetheless improved the accuracy of the results.
                          Current coverage in Area 21 is about 90 percent, compared to 66 percent under the
                          previous methodology. When weighted by production, the volume of landings from
                          sustainably fished stocks increases significantly under both the previous and current
                          methodologies (TABLE D.1.5), indicating that larger stocks are more sustainably fished.
                             To conclude, while catches have declined in recent decades, stock status has generally
                          been improving, so catches are likely to stabilize and perhaps somewhat increase as many
                          stocks recover productivity.

  Area 21 is one of the oldest commercial fisheries in the world, and has
   some of the longest data and information timeseries.
  Fishing for groundfish stocks has decreased, and some historically
   important stocks (e.g. Northern cod) have not recovered.
  The economic value of shellfish stocks has increased, which are largely
   taken by small vessels, using pots and traps. However, these fisheries are
   very sensitive to environmental changes and climate change.

1. OVERVIEW
The Northeast Atlantic, designated by FAO as Major Fishing Area 27 (hereafter, Area 27),
encompasses the exclusive economic zones (EEZ) of western European and eastern Atlantic
Arctic countries,1 extending from the high seas between Greenland and the Azores in the
west to the brackish waters of the Baltic Sea in the east (FIGURE D.2.1). It covers a total area
of 14.3 million km2, of which 2.7 million km2 is continental shelf. The main oceanographic

    Countries in Area 27 include Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Latvia,
    Lithuania, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, the Russian Federation, Spain, Sweden,
    and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
27                   84                                                         Review of the state of world marine fishery resources




                          features are a subpolar and a subtropical gyre, which are driven predominantly by the North
                          Atlantic Current originating from the Caribbean. Other key features include the extended
Northeast Atlantic




                          shelf area off northern Europe, the semi-enclosed Baltic Sea, and the summer upwellings
                          off the coast of Spain and Portugal. Circulation of waters separated by temperature, salinity
                          and density results in warmer water moving across from the Caribbean via the British Isles
                          on to Iceland and then Greenland. This circulation affects water temperature and primary
                          production (e.g. phytoplankton), driving large-scale changes in fisheries’ productivity.
                          The Northeast Atlantic is the fourth-most-productive marine fishing area in the world,
                          accounting for over 10 percent of global catches, and has had an important social and
                          economic impact on European history and development. The “Fish Revolution” of the
                          1500s led to a 15-fold increase in cod supplies and tripled overall supplies of fish input
                          to the European market (Holm et al., 2022). The fisheries of the Northeast Atlantic
                          expanded rapidly in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries as fishing became
                          increasingly industrial and more advanced technology was applied. Since the 1950s, the
                          Northeast Atlantic has seen a significant reduction in the number of vessels and people
                          employed in the sector, but there has been a corresponding increase in the fishing power
                          of vessels, so the overall fishing pressure on marine ecosystems increased in many fisheries
                          until the twenty-first century. Since then, fisheries have been recovering slowly over the
                          last 30 years through improved management.
                             Most landings in the Area are from industrial fisheries, but inshore small-scale fish-
                          eries still operate traps, gillnets and small trawls over most of the coastline. In addition,
                          Indigenous Peoples in the Northeast Atlantic have utilized marine resources and have
                          fished in the region for thousands of years, mainly using a variety of traps, nets, and hooks-
                          and-lines in coastal and inland waters. Total annual marine captures have increased from
                          an average of around 6.7 million tonnes in the 1950s to an average of about 10.7 million
                          tonnes during the period 1970–2000, with a peak of around 13 million tonnes in 1976.
                          Total marine captures have fallen to between 8 million tonnes and 10 million tonnes
                          since 2005 (FIGURE D.2.3).
                             Within the total marine catch, the composition of species has changed over time.
                          Declines in fisheries for traditional species such as Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), haddock
                          (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) and Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) have been compen-
                          sated for by the development of fisheries for formerly lower-valued species such as blue
                          whiting (Micromesistius poutassou). In addition, some stocks which had previously been
                          depleted have now recovered.
                             Unlike in most other regions, the fisheries in Area 27 tend not to be managed on a strict
                          country-by-country basis; instead, management reflects broad environmental divisions as
                          well as historical access to resources as described in the next section. This is the result of
                          early recognition that most of the main fisheries were shared between nations. Traditional
                          fishing grounds for some countries were often within the waters adjacent to other nations,
                          and fish routinely migrate through waters adjacent to several nations within the region.

                          2. FISHERY PROFILES
                          This section begins by setting out the overall profile of fisheries in Area 27 at the regional
                          level, and then explores more specific profiles according to subareas of the International
                          Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) (FIGURE D.2.2).
                          2.1 Regional governance and management
                          The North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) is the regional fisheries
                          management organization (RFMO) for the Northeast Atlantic. However, the declara-
                          tion of 200 nautical miles (nm) EEZs in 1982 and the establishment of the European
                          Union Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) resulted in a reduction of NEAFC’s area of
                          responsibility. With regards to fish stocks occurring exclusively within the jurisdiction
                          of coastal states, the relevant countries or the European Union manage the resource, and
                          this applies to most stocks in the region. This means that NEAFC is primarily responsible

for managing fisheries in high seas regions within Area 27, its role largely confined
to shared stocks that occur in international waters such as beaked redfish (Sebastes
mentella), Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus), spring-spawning Atlanto-Scandian
herring (Clupea harengus) and blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou). NEAFC adopts
management and control measures to ensure management objectives are met, including
an objective to protect the marine ecosystem from potential negative fisheries impacts.

     Report. https://doi.org/10.17895/ices.advice.23634480.v1




   At the regional level, ICES – an intergovernmental marine science organization –
provides fisheries management advice for stocks within Area 27. NEAFC recommends
and coordinates measures to maintain the rational exploitation of fish stocks in its
Convention Area, using scientific advice from ICES. Most fisheries are managed using
stock-specific total allowable catches (TACs); therefore, ICES is typically requested to
provide catch advice on a stock-by-stock basis.
   For countries that are members of the European Union, competence for fisheries
management lies with the European Commission and is administered by the Directorate-
General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries (DG MARE). The CFP, the governing
framework for fisheries management within the European Union, was set up with the
intention of reducing overfishing and building long-term sustainable management of fish-
eries stocks. This fisheries governance has largely translated into an ecosystem approach
to fisheries management, which aims to integrate the protection of the marine ecosystem
as a whole with the sustainable fishing of its resources. Countries outside the European
Union have policies that are broadly aligned with the CFP, but independently control
27                   86                                                                     Review of the state of world marine fishery resources




                          access to fishery resources. In most cases TACs are used to control harvest and quotas
                          are distributed among nations through negotiation. There are currently seven Advisory
Northeast Atlantic




                          Councils (ACs, previously Regional Advisory Councils), which were established after
                          the revision of the CFP in 2002 (EU, 2004; EU, 2007). The objective of the ACs is to
                          work towards integrated and sustainable management of fisheries, based on the ecosys-
                          tem and precautionary approaches. They provide a way for stakeholders to discuss issues
                          and develop management plans.
                          2.2 The Baltic Sea
                          The Baltic Sea (ICES subarea 3) is the second-largest semi-enclosed brackish-water sea in
                          the world (the Black Sea is the largest). It is characterized by a perennial vertical stratifica-
                          tion and seasonal sea ice. The topography of the Baltic Sea consists of deep basins that assist
                          in moving saltier water with higher quantities of oxygen in, while a freshwater current
                          flows closer to the surface and out into the North Sea (HELCOM, 2023). The Baltic Sea
                          is therefore divided into two strata with limited mixing. The oxygen-rich inflows cause an
                          infrequent flushing event that is vital to removing pollutants, reducing the concentrations
                          of nutrients and increasing the oxygen content of the water. The saltwater incursions in
                          the south generate unique environmental conditions that impact fisheries management
                          strategies. Deeper water can have large volumes with low oxygen levels, which has a direct
                          impact on the ecosystem.
                              The Baltic Sea region includes nine countries, with many historic trade routes passing
                          across the sea.2 The area has a rich and complex history of fishing spanning thousands of
                          years. Around 85 million people live in the Baltic Sea drainage basin, with the majority
                          living south of the coast. Pollution from inland and marine sources is an important concern
                          in the area. Bycatch of seabirds and marine mammals remains a problem, particularly in
                          static gear such as gillnets. Climate change is also causing higher water temperatures and
                          reducing sea ice, with related changes to the hydrological cycle (Meier et al., 2022).
                              More than 50 species are caught within the Baltic Sea but only 12 of these, covering
                          around 20 stocks, are assessed. Overall fishing activities decreased by 50 percent between
                          2004 and 2012, and landings have continued to decline (ICES, 2022a). Cod (Gadus
                          morhua), herring and European sprat (Sprattus sprattus) make up 95 percent of the total
                          catch. Midwater trawling targets herring and sprat, whereas demersal trawling targets
                          cod and flatfish. Total landings have generally been decreasing since the 1970s. Since
                          2003, total landings have stabilized, although fishing effort has decreased. The region has
                          significant small-scale coastal fleets, and more than 4 000 full-time jobs continue to rely
                          on the Baltic Sea fisheries sector (HELCOM, 2023). Recreational fishing is common and
                          targets a variety of species, although landings are mainly cod, sea trout (Salmo trutta) and
                          salmon. Management of these stocks is made complicated by environmental conditions,
                          which have a significant impact on stock productivity and make it difficult to predict
                          changes in stock status.
                          2.3 Arctic, Barents, Norwegian, Icelandic, Faroes and Greenland Seas
                          The area of the Northeast Atlantic that lies within the Arctic Circle includes Iceland and
                          the Faroes Grounds, the Barents Sea, the Norwegian Sea, Svalbard, the Bear Island and
                          Northeast Greenland (ICES subareas 1, 2 and 5). The Arctic region of the Northeast
                          Atlantic continues the deep ridges up from the south, with sea ice occurring seasonally
                          in the north and contributing to higher variations in light and temperature. The water
                          movement is dominated by warmer water moving north into the east of the region, while
                          cooler water sinks and flows south through the Denmark Strait between Greenland and
                          Iceland. The Norwegian Sea is a zone of transition for warmer, saline waters from the
                          Atlantic and colder Arctic waters. However, the last two decades have seen an increase
                          of Atlantic waters moving into this region (Tsubouchi et al., 2021).

                          2
                              These countries include Estonia, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the Russian Federation
                              and Sweden.
PART D.2 ■ Regional Overview ■ Area 27: Northeast Atlantic                                          87




   Despite a low human population of around 2.6 million, this region has high fisher-
ies productivity. The Norwegian Sea, the Icelandic Grounds and the Barents Sea lead in
terms of landings. Fisheries are a vital industry, contributing a relatively high proportion
to regional gross domestic product (GDP), albeit this is in decline as countries diversify
their economies through sectors including renewable energy production, tourism and
aquaculture.
   The largest harvested fish stocks are pelagic – Norwegian spring-spawning herring,
mackerel and blue whiting – but there is also a significant demersal fishery, primarily on
Atlantic cod. The Barents Sea is one of the most productive regions worldwide, and has
had the largest catch in the Arctic area (Troell et al., 2017). Overall, six fish species are the
main contributors to the fishing industry: Atlantic cod, saithe (Pollachius virens), haddock
(Melanogrammus aeglefinus), blue whiting, herring and capelin (Mallotus villosus), with
spawning grounds along the Nordic coast. Fisheries also exist for introduced species such
as queen crab (Chionoecetes opilio), a recent arrival first observed in 1996, and red king
crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus) that were introduced from the Pacific by the Union of
Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR, now the Russian Federation) in the 1960s.
   Fisheries are primarily managed using quotas, and habitats are protected by closing
various areas to particular gear types. However, the Faroes demersal fishery (mainly for
haddock and cod) is managed using effort quotas (fishing days) rather than catch quotas.
More than 60 percent of the Faroe Plateau is no longer accessible to bottom-fishing for at
least some of the year to protect biodiversity and spawning stocks (ICES, 2024b). Fisheries
on stocks shared between Norway and the Russian Federation are managed through the
Norwegian–Russian Fishery Commission.
   Climate change has impacted water temperatures, sea levels and salinity (ICES, 2024c).
The Barents Sea has reported the warmest decade on record, with several species moving
north. Warming waters have also been linked to reduced stock numbers and changed
distribution of several cold-water species. Impacts to the ecosystem of the region also come
from underwater noise and marine traffic, pollutants and invasive species.
2.4 Greater North Sea and Celtic Seas
The Greater North Sea and Celtic Seas (ICES subareas 4, 6 and 7), including Skagerrak,
the eastern English Channel, the Irish Sea, the Celtic Sea, the west of Scotland and the
North Sea, lie on the continental shelf surrounding the British Isles and the nearby
European coast. The North Sea itself is a semi-enclosed relatively shallow sea, connected to
the Baltic Sea in the east and the Atlantic in the north and west. Water from the Atlantic
enters from the south through the Celtic Sea and up through the Irish Sea. The Celtic
Seas ecoregion extends along to the western coast of Britain and includes semi-enclosed
seas and part of the Atlantic continental shelf. This ecoregion is significantly affected by
the Gulf Stream, which carries warmer water up from the Caribbean.
   The area’s fisheries have a long history of industrialization and production, with large
quantities of cod and herring being produced from England, Scotland and Ireland by
the end of the nineteenth century (Smed and Ramster, 2002), leading to concerns of
overfishing. This local depletion led to significant expansion in fishing areas for these
fleets, culminating in the ‘Cod Wars’ between the United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland (hereafter, the United Kingdom) and Iceland in the 1970s. With
regards to herring, long-term data shows significant changes in commercial fish stocks since
1902, resulting in less productivity, damage to ecosystems, and conflicts between fishing
communities (Fock, Kloppmann and Probst, 2014). Agreed policies and regulations have
improved these fisheries, although issues still arise over stresses on the marine environment,
quota allocation, and catches with mixtures of species. Overall, many stocks are recovering,
or have recovered from decades of overfishing, but fisheries make a significantly smaller
contribution to local economies than they did in the twentieth century. Nevertheless, many
communities remain dependent on small-scale fishing, mainly for shellfish.
   Today, trawling is responsible for most of the landings in the North Sea and Celtic Seas,
although a wide range of gears operate including drift nets, pots, hooks and lines, and
27                   88                                                         Review of the state of world marine fishery resources




                          dredges. Significant fisheries continue for cod, herring and mackerel, as well as many other
                          species caught in smaller quantities but popular in markets such as common sole (Solea
Northeast Atlantic




                          solea) and turbot (Scophthalmus maximus). Larger-scale fisheries are heavily centralized
                          and supply an international market.
                             There are more than 50 stocks present in the North Sea that are assessed by ICES,
                          with several stocks having a distribution beyond the North and Celtic Seas. Important
                          stocks in terms of landings include mackerel, herring, Atlantic cod, haddock, saithe and
                          European plaice (Pleuronectes platessa). There is also a relatively large trawl and pot fish-
                          ery for Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus). European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax),
                          common sole, turbot, common shrimp (Crangon crangon), cockles, European lobster
                          (Homarus gammarus) and edible crab (Cancer pagurus) have significant catches, which
                          are important in local fisheries and markets. Fisheries in the area are susceptible to vari-
                          ous environmental and human-induced impacts, including those resulting from climate
                          change, industrial and agricultural pollution, extraction of sand and gravel, offshore wind
                          turbine construction, and shipping traffic.
                          2.5 Bay of Biscay, the Iberian coast and the Azores
                          Waters in the lower west half of Area 27 flow down the coasts of France, Portugal and the
                          southern edge of Spain and then westward into the Atlantic towards the Azores (ICES
                          subareas 8, 9, 10 and 12). The region consists of the relatively shallow coast of Spain,
                          Portugal and France, out over the continental shelf running down beside the Iberian
                          Peninsula and into the Atlantic Ocean. Within the large open ocean ecosystem lie the
                          Azores, composed of nine islands straddling the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. This area of the
                          Atlantic is a highly productive and complex ecosystem with extensive fishing interests.
                          The main ecological areas are the upwelling off the Iberian Peninsula and oceanic waters
                          around the Azores north to Iceland and Greenland.
                             The Iberian coast and the Bay of Biscay have a high diversity of fish and cephalopods,
                          creating excellent fishing grounds. The productivity of this region is due to upwelling
                          and additional nutritional input from rivers. The most common fishing gears are demer-
                          sal otter trawls targeting demersal species, but the highest landings are from midwater
                          trawls catching European pilchard (Sardina pilchardus), European anchovy (Engraulis
                          encrasicolus) and Atlantic horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus). The area also supports
                          marine and coastal aquaculture as well as capture fisheries.
                             Different fish species are targeted by French and Spanish vessels. The French fleet
                          tends to target species lower on the trophic levels such as sardine and anchovy, while the
                          Spanish fleet tends to target more higher trophic level species (mackerel, blue whiting,
                          seabass, whiting [Merlangius merlangus] and European hake [Merluccius merluccius]), but
                          not exclusively (Corrales et al., 2022). The main demersal fisheries of the Iberian region
                          are hake, whiting, anglerfish (Lophius piscatorius) and megrim (Lepidorhombus whiffi-
                          agonis). European hake is a limiting species in the demersal fishery, and is considered at
                          maximum harvest level.
                             The Azores have their own 200 nm EEZ. The archipelago consists of nine islands
                          and a further 461 seamounts within the EEZ that support diverse types of fisheries.
                          Smaller vessels target a large variety of species, including pelagics such as blue jack mack-
                          erel (Trachurus picturatus) and blackspot seabream (Pagellus bogaraveo), and demersal
                          fish such as the high-value groupers, blacktail comber (Serranus atricauda) and dusky
                          grouper (Epinephelus marginatus). The diverse grouper fishery uses handlines, gillnets
                          and longlines, and is managed locally. Demersal trawling is banned in the area. As well
                          as fishing, the islands are at risk from impacts from tourism, marine litter and marine
                          transport. Waters around the Azores have been warming in recent years, with the plank-
                          ton community shifting towards smaller taxa and the rate of detection of non-indigenous
                          species increasing (ICES, 2024a). There are important habitats for cold-water corals also
                          at risk from ocean warming and acidification.
                             The open ocean fisheries catches, which encompass those in the high seas, include
                          tuna (PART E.1, GLOBAL TUNA FISHERIES, pp. 330), beaked redfish (Sebastes mentella) and

blue whiting, particularly further north, and predominantly with pelagic trawls (ICES,
2024d). Deeper-water species such as ling (Molva molva), blue ling (Molva dypterygia),
tusk (Brosme brosme), roughsnout grenadier (Trachyrincus scabrus) and alfonsinos (Beryx
spp.) are caught with longlines and trawls, but fishing in deeper water may also have a high
bycatch of sharks and other vulnerable deep-water species, which makes them more diffi-
cult to manage. Many of these smaller demersal fisheries take place on or near seamounts
and overlap with other ecoregions.

3. RESOURCE STATUS

3.1 Reference list of stocks
The updated reference list of stocks expands the number of stocks assessed in Area 27
from 34 assessment units to 178 stock units, representing 49 species (TABLE D.2.1 and
APPENDIX II, TABLE 2 , pp. 418). This increase is mainly linked to the updated approach
(PART B, METHODOLOGY, pp. 6) whereby the resolution has increased through a focus on
individual fish stocks rather than only species. For example, under the previous methodol-
ogy, all common sole (Solea solea) stocks in Area 27 were treated as a group within “Other
flounders, halibuts, soles”, whereas in the updated assessment they have been separated
into ten different units as identified by ICES. For a few Northeast Atlantic-wide stocks,
such as blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou) and Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus),
the evaluation remains the same.

   Stock units for Area 27 are now much more precise than referenced previously, given
that ICES strives to define stocks as separate populations that are self-recruiting. In prac-
tice though, some stocks are defined with reference to the way fisheries operate and are
managed, and some stocks are still considered in groups. For example, although Atlantic
salmon (Salmo salar) from different rivers have separate spawning components and could
be considered to be separate stocks, in this report they are combined into a few stock
complexes, since mixed catches of these stocks are taken when they are caught at sea.
Furthermore, scientific research may split or combine other stock definitions as under-
standing of the biology and ecology of these populations improves.
   It is important to note that not all stocks, species and populations for Area 27 are
included in this assessment. Indeed, of the total number of stocks in the Area (235 stocks),
only 178 are assessed stocks, meaning that 57 stocks remain unassessed. This does not
include the many inshore stocks whose stock assessments are not accessible or published.
These stocks may also not have been consistently assessed and may only represent relatively

                          small landings, so have been excluded. However, it is possible that smaller inshore stocks
                          could be included in the future if assessments are published. In addition, the stocks to be
Northeast Atlantic




                          assessed by ICES vary; although the most important “pressure” stocks, such as many of
                          the Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) stocks, are assessed each year, those stocks for which
                          there is little data and which are bycatch may be assessed less frequently.
                          3.2 Classification of the status of stocks
                          3.2.1 METHODOLOGY
                          The resource status described in this chapter is primarily based upon 2022 and 2023 ICES
                          advice (published on the ICES website). The default ICES approach to providing advice
                          attempts to integrate the precautionary approach with the objective of achieving maxi-
                          mum sustainable yield (MSY) (Annex 2 of the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement
                          [UN, 1995]), unless otherwise requested. ICES’s interpretation of MSY is maximizing
                          the average long-term yield from a given fish stock while maintaining the productivity of
                          the stock. However, ICES considers that the MSY reference points it uses are valid only
                          in the short and medium term (generally up to five to ten years), because of unknowable
                          longer-term changes that are occurring, such as climate change. As a result, ICES does
                          not generally measure stock status against some inferred unexploited state. Rather, advice
                          is usually focused on fishing mortality or harvest rate that should maximize long-term
                          yield, while setting a lower limit on spawning stock biomass above which no decline in
                          recruitment is expected (or detectable).3
                             Within territorial waters many fisheries are managed through local systems, which
                          will not necessarily be based on a stock assessment. In most cases, these local fisheries
                          do not get advice from ICES. For example, shellfish such as oysters, mussels, cockles and
                          clams are primarily managed through area-based management that limits the take based
                          on traditional access arrangements, or that operates using habitat enhancements such as
                          ropes. For these stocks, there may not be traditional stock assessments, but surveys may
                          be carried out annually that collect stock abundance data. Instead of optimizing these
                          fisheries to harvest them at MSY, the management aim is to maintain the fisheries by
                          applying limits that sustain them. Although landings from such inshore stocks may not
                          be large, quantities are still considerable and important for local fishing communities.

                          3.2.2 STOCK STATUS AND CLASSIFICATION BY TIERS
                          Estimates of stock status have generally improved; currently, about 75.8 percent of assessed
                          stocks are thought to be fished within sustainable levels (TABLE D.2.2), where “sustainable”
                          is defined relative to MSY or its proxies. Most of the traditional fishery resources of the
                          Northeast Atlantic are maximally sustainably fished or overfished. There have been
                          notable improvements in the status of some larger stocks, such as Northeast polar cod
                          (Boreogadus saida), Northeast Arctic haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), mackerel
                          (Scomber scombrus), and the Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) stocks. Other stocks,
                          such as North Sea cod, are still in recovery, which is made more difficult by the nature of
                          the mixed demersal fisheries operating in the North Sea. Specifically, about 10.1 percent
                          of assessed stocks are considered underfished, 65.7 percent are considered maximally
                          sustainably fished, and 24.2 are overfished. Almost all assessed stocks in Area 27 are
                          considered Tier 1, given that ICES uses them as the basis for formal advice in the region.
                             When weighted by their production level, an estimated 86.6 percent of the 2021
                          landings were from biologically sustainable stocks (TABLE D.2.3), a similar result to the
                          percentage of marine stocks fished within biologically sustainable levels by number
                          (TABLE D.2.4).


                          3
                              ICES uses precautionary reference points for spawning stock biomass Bpa as the reference point for management
                              considering it as a proxy for biomass for the maximum sustainable yield BMSY. However, an analysis done by Winker
                              and Cardinale (ICES, 2022b) demonstrates this is more akin to the limit reference point for spawning stock biomass
                              Blim.

4. KEY SELECTED GROUPS AND SPECIES
The main species in terms of landings for Area 27 (FIGURE D.2.3) are Atlantic herring
(Clupea harengus), blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou), Atlantic cod (Gadus
morhua), Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus), European sprat (Sprattus sprattus), saithe
(Pollachius virens), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), sandeels NEI (Ammodytes
spp.), capelin (Mallotus villosus), beaked redfish (Sebastes mentella) and Atlantic horse
mackerel (Trachurus trachurus).
4.1 Atlantic cod
Catches of Atlantic cod consistently made the largest contribution to the total of cods, hakes
and haddocks until 1998, when they were exceeded by blue whiting landings. A persistent
downward trend in cod catches is evident from the peak in the late 1960s, although the
lower catches in recent years can be attributed in part to the ongoing rebuilding programme
for North Sea cod. Importantly, larger cod fisheries in Iceland and the Arctic (ICES areas
1 and 2) have sustained high catches at full exploitation. Most other significant cod stocks
are overfished and need to be rebuilt. Because they are caught in mixed fisheries, and because
other environmental factors such as climate change may be affecting recruitment, rebuilding
has proved difficult to achieve. A rebuilding plan for North Sea cod achieved some success
from 2005 to 2017 but was ended prematurely, and the spawning stock has returned to low
levels in recent years, while rebuilding has had to be restarted.

                                      prolonged depletion. Western Baltic cod appears to be recovering, but Eastern Baltic cod
                                      may not be. In addition, the Baltic cod fishery has had considerable problems with monitor-
                                      ing and control, particularly under-reporting of catches 1993–1996 and 2000–2007; and
                                      more recently, Eastern Baltic cod has been impacted by environmental effects impacting
                                      growth and mortality. This makes assessment and management of this stock more difficult.
                                         Cod stocks form most of the landings in Area 27. West of Scotland, Irish Sea and Celtic
                                      Sea cod are considered to have reduced reproductive capacity. Only the status of Rockall
                                      cod remains unknown. Catches of the small Rockall stock appear to have declined with-
                                      out management intervention.
                                      4.2 Mackerel
                                      Atlantic mackerel now makes the largest contribution to ISSCAAP group 37 in Area 27.
                                      The average catch between the mid-1970s and the mid-2000s was around 600 000 tonnes/
                                      year, and since 2006 has been around 1 million tonnes/year. Atlantic mackerel is assessed
                                      as a single stock for the Northeast Atlantic, although it is made up of several spawning
                                      components. The spawning stock biomass (SSB) has increased from a low of 2 million
                                      tonnes in 2003 to around 3.7 million tonnes in 2019. This is despite catches considerably
                                      exceeding scientific advice, with the sustained level of the spawning stock instead being
                                      the fortunate result of strong recruitment. Although the stock as a whole is at full repro-
                                      ductive capacity, the North Sea component is still depleted and catches in the North Sea
                                      are prohibited at appropriate times to encourage its recovery.
                                         Mackerel is a highly mobile species and shoals have moved to different areas, changing
                                      fishing opportunities for different countries. Recent international management problems
                                      are partly due to the summer mackerel distribution extending further northwards in
                                      recent decades so that the stock is being commercially fished in areas where it was previ-
                                      ously not fished, particularly in the Icelandic EEZ.

4.3 Herring
Atlantic herring is a demersal spawner, usually spawning on gravel beds, and its stock
structure is generally complex. Populations may mix but then spawn separately at different
times of year and in different areas. For example, the main North Sea herring stock, the
autumn-spawning North Sea herring, consists of a number of spawning components,
landings from which cannot be separated and are therefore treated as a single stock.
Herring may suffer from periods of poor recruitment, which makes it vulnerable to
overfishing if there is no proportionate and timely management response. The largest
populations of Norwegian spring spawners and North Sea autumn spawners are maxi-
mally sustainably fished, but other populations in the Baltic and west of the United
Kingdom are currently overfished. The West of Ireland and Scotland herring stock
recently changed from overfished to maximally sustainably fished. There are some other
small spring-spawning herring stocks associated with gravel beds and river estuaries,
which are managed locally.
4.4 Lobsters
Catches of lobsters (ISSCAAP group 43), which include the valuable Norway lobster
(Nephrops norvegicus) fisheries, have increased since the early 1950s, stabilizing at current
levels since the 1990s. Norway lobster is managed primarily in “functional units”, which
are separate areas of the burrowed mud that the species inhabits. These units are primarily
managed through monitoring length and sex composition, and conducting remote
observation vehicle surveys to obtain hole density. These separate sources of information
allow management to set sustainable harvest rates for each unit. On the whole, sustainable
harvest rates are achieved by limiting access and controlling fishing activity rather than
by a specific TAC applied to each unit, although TACs are set across units. Most units
are maximally sustainably fished, while some show densities below target levels and may
need rebuilding. There is generally insufficient information to determine the status of
populations outside these designated units.
   European lobster (Homarus gammarus) represents only a small proportion of the catch
volume, albeit it is important for small inshore fisheries. Generally, the stock status is not
known, and it is managed through precautionary interventions, mainly trap limits, mini-
mum sizes and techniques like “V-notching”. V-notching, usually in the tail, is used to
mark individual lobsters that have been returned to the sea because of their small size or
because they have eggs. Fishers agree to return the lobster to the sea if it is caught again
until the notch disappears through moulting, which protects a proportion of the stock.
These initiatives are usually promoted where it is believed that these inshore populations
are at risk of overexploitation.

                          5. KEY FINDINGS
Northeast Atlantic




                          The majority of stocks that have been assessed for Area 27 are at maximum sustainable
                          levels of harvest, but significant numbers of stocks are still either overfished or their status
                          is unknown. There has been an expansion of stocks where advice has been requested, and
                          in many cases further data collection and research is required before their status can be
                          determined. Nonetheless, the largest important stocks have sufficient data so that they
                          can be assessed quite accurately. Some stocks are considered underfished, but these are
                          often part of mixed fisheries, so opportunities to increase harvest may still be limited.
                          For example, in the North Sea demersal fisheries the limiting stock is cod, and in Iberian
                          waters it is hake. This also means that management controls, when implemented, may
                          affect the status of a wide range of stocks, not only because of constraints on fishing
                          opportunities, but also due to rationalization of fleets to improve economic performance.
                             The number of stocks being assessed in Area 27 has significantly increased under the
                          new methodology, going from 34 to 178 stocks. Overall, landings of assessed stocks in
                          Area 27 represented 91.3 percent of total landings reported in 2021, an increase from
                          84.2 percent covered by the previous methodology. There has been a general trend in the
                          Area to assess more stocks as more data have become available, assessment methods have
                          improved and assessments for high-priority stocks have matured, freeing up ICES tech-
                          nical working groups’ time for other stocks. The level of sustainability of stocks has stayed
                          similar, with 75.8 percent of assessed stocks considered sustainable under the updated
                          methodology, compared to 79.4 percent under the previous methodology (TABLE D.2.4).
                          When weighted by their production level, an estimated 86.6 percent of the 2021 landings
                          were from biologically sustainable stocks (TABLE D.2.5).
                             In terms of fisheries management performance, control over fisheries has shown a posi-
                          tive trend. There have been notable improvements in the status of some larger stocks, such
                          as Northeast polar cod (Boreogadus saida), Northeast Arctic haddock (Melanogrammus
                          aeglefinus), mackerel (Scomber scombrus), and the larger herring (Clupea harengus) stocks.
                          Other stocks, such as North Sea cod, are still in recovery, made more difficult by the nature
                          of the mixed demersal fisheries operating in the North Sea.
                             For the Oceanic Northeast Atlantic, Greater North Sea, Celtic Seas and Baltic Seas
                          ICES ecoregions, there has been a declining mean fishing mortality for stocks over the
                          last two decades, although in many cases the current fishing mortality still remains higher
                          than the target level. For pelagic stocks, fishing mortality has been fluctuating with no
                          clear trend and has periodically risen above the MSY level. For the Norwegian Sea, Barents
                          Sea and Greenland Sea ecoregions, overall fishing mortality has been more stable for both
                          demersal and pelagic stocks. For Icelandic waters, larger demersal stocks show a clear
                          reduction in fishing mortality across fisheries over the last decade, while smaller stocks
                          show a stable or shallow increase over much of the same period with a recent decline to
                          the target level based on management intervention for these species. For pelagics, fishing
                          mortality has also approached the target level for the main species.
                             Finally, the issue of reference points for assessing the state of exploitation of stocks in
                          Area 27 is being debated by the ICES Scientific Working Group; depending on its deci-
                          sion, there may be implications for estimating the sustainability of fish stocks for Area
                          27 in the future.

  Following decades of improved management, fish stocks and habitats
   are generally recovering and overfishing is declining.
  Climate risk can lead to conflicts over resources as important
   commercial stocks shift ranges or suffer declines.
  Albeit generally fishing constitutes only a small fraction of the GDP
   in the region, it is still economically important to Iceland, the Faroe
   Islands and Greenland. Fisheries are socially and culturally important in
   the wider region.
  Many local and Indigenous communities depend on fishing
   (culturally, economically and in terms of food security).

1. OVERVIEW
The Western Central Atlantic, designated as FAO Major Fishing Area 31 (hereafter,
Area 31) (FIGURE D.3.1), includes approximately 14.7 million km2 of marine areas extending
from Cape Hatteras in the state of North Carolina, United States of America (hereafter,
United States) (at 35° north), along the eastern coast of the Americas to French Guiana in
the south (at 5° north). Eastwards it extends to 40° west longitude in the high seas (FAO,
2024a). Area 31 covers the southeastern coast of the United States, the Gulf of Mexico, the
Caribbean Sea and the northeastern coast of South America, with an estimated continental
shelf area of 1.4 million km2. Small-scale, semi-industrial and industrial fisheries harvested
around 1.2 million tonnes of fish and invertebrate species in 2021 (FAO, 2024b).

                                    Area 31 is notably heterogeneous in geographic, ecological, political, economic and
                                 cultural terms. It encompasses the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of 27 countries,1
                                 of which 16 are small island developing states (SIDS), and 19 are overseas territories of
                                 France, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
                                 Northern Ireland (hereafter, the United Kingdom), and the United States.2
                                    The oceanographic circulation in the Western Central Atlantic is dominated by the
                                 westward flow of the North Equatorial Current and the Antilles Current to the north,
                                 and the Guianas Current and the Caribbean Current to the south. A recurrent feature is
                                 the presence of anticyclonic gyres (North Brazil Current rings) that enter the Caribbean
                                 region through the Lesser Antilles and may help deliver waters with relatively low salin-
                                 ity and high nutrient levels into the marine environment of this island chain (Fratantoni
                                 and Glickson, 2002; Aroucha et al., 2020). The Caribbean Current enters the Gulf of
                                 Mexico through the Yucatan Channel to form the Loop Current, which exits through the

Straits of Florida as the Florida Straits Current, and which then merges with the Antilles
Current to form the Gulf Stream (FIGURE D.3.2).
   The Western Central Atlantic, especially the Caribbean Sea, harbours the highest
species diversity in the Atlantic Ocean and represents a global hotspot of marine biodi-
versity (Roberts et al., 2002; Miloslavich et al., 2010). The productivity of Area 31 is
relatively heterogeneous; the most productive regions are related to riverine input and
upwelling systems, especially in the Gulf of Mexico and along the northeastern shelf of
South America. In addition, coral reefs, coastal lagoons, mangrove forests and seagrass
beds are highly productive and sustain important fishery resources.

2. FISHERY PROFILES
Given the regional geopolitical complexity of the Western Central Atlantic in terms
of countries and overseas territories, this section addresses the fishery profiles of the
region from the perspective of the large marine ecosystem (LME) concept (Sherman and
Hempel, 2008). The Western Central Atlantic encompasses four LMEs: the northern
half of the North Brazil Shelf LME, the Caribbean Sea LME, the Gulf of Mexico LME
and the Southeast United States Continental Shelf LME. Additionally, towards the
northern limit of Area 31 is located the Bermuda marine ecoregion, which represents
the northernmost limit for coral reef ecosystems in the Atlantic Ocean; however, given
that this region is only a small part of Area 31 and is more relevant for open ocean areas
beyond national jurisdiction, it is not addressed in this chapter and is instead covered in
the chapter on deep-sea fisheries (PART E.2, DEEP-SEA FISHERIES, pp. 377).
2.1 The Southeast United States continental shelf
large marine ecosystem
The Southeast United States continental shelf LME extends from Cape Hatteras, North
Carolina, to the Straits of Florida. This LME covers around 273 000 km2 , with an
extensive continental shelf covering approximately 131 000 km2 and containing around
0.27 percent of the world’s coral reefs. There are an important number of estuarine
ecosystems, including the Albemarle-Pamlico Sound in North Carolina which is the
second-largest estuary in the United States. This LME is considered a moderately produc-
tive ecosystem, with yearly primary production ranging 150–300 g/cm2 (Aquarone,
2008). Recreational and commercial fisheries exploit coastal pelagic species such as
common dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus), king mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla)
and Atlantic Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus maculatus), as well as highly migratory
species such as swordfish (Xiphias gladius), albacore (Thunnus alalunga), Atlantic sailfish
(Istiophorus albicans), and various shark species. Among the most abundant invertebrate
species exploited are the northern white shrimp (Litopeaneus setiferus), northern brown
shrimp (Penaeus aztecus) and blue crab (Callinectes sapidus).
2.2 The Gulf of Mexico large marine ecosystem
The Gulf of Mexico is the largest semi-enclosed area in the Western Atlantic. It is bordered
by the United States, Mexico and Cuba, and has an area of approximately 1.5 million
km2 . The continental shelf of this LME is the most extensive in Area 31, with a total
surface area of around 570 000 km2 . It comprises around 0.6 percent of the world’s
coral reefs, mainly along the southwestern coast of Florida. The primary productivity in
the Area is considered moderate, with yearly values usually less than 300 g/cm2 , and is
highly influenced by freshwater and nutrient inputs from rivers and extensive estuaries,
especially the Mississippi-Atchafalaya basin, as well as upwelling along the edge of the
Loop Current (Heileman and Rabalais, 2008). Recreational, small-scale, semi-industrial
and industrial fisheries exploit important stocks of fish and invertebrates. The Gulf
menhaden (Brevoortia patronus) industrial purse seine fishery is the largest fishery in
the Western Central Atlantic in terms of landings, while industrial trawl fisheries for
northern white, northern brown and northern pink (Penaeus duoraru) shrimps are the
31                         102                                                         Review of the state of world marine fishery resources



                                 largest shrimp fisheries in Area 31. Other important fisheries include the exploitation of
Western Central Atlantic




                                 red grouper (Epinephelus morio) and northern red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus), the
                                 small-scale and semi-industrial fisheries for common octopus (Octopus vulgaris) aand
                                 Mexican four-eyed octopus (Octopus maya), as well as the estuarine-associated small-scale
                                 fisheries for blue crab and American cupped oyster (Crassostrea virginica).
                                 2.3 The Caribbean Sea large marine ecosystem
                                 The Caribbean Sea is a tropical body of water bounded by the continental landmass of
                                 the Americas to the west and south, the Greater Antilles to the north and the Lesser
                                 Antilles to the east. This LME is the largest in the region. It covers around 3.3 million km2
                                 and contains about 7 percent of the world’s coral reefs. The total shelf area is around
                                 518 000 km2 , with main areas corresponding to the Honduras-Nicaragua rise in Central
                                 America, the northern and northeastern coasts of South America along Colombia and
                                 the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, and around the Bahamas and Cuba. Overall,
                                 annual primary productivity is moderate (150–300 g/cm2), but given the extent and
                                 characteristics of this LME it is very heterogeneous, with areas of high productivity asso-
                                 ciated with the deltas and plumes of major rivers (e.g. the Orinoco and the Magdalena),
                                 estuarine areas (e.g. Lake Maracaibo), upwelling areas along the coasts of Colombia
                                 and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, and coastal and insular habitats (coral reefs,
                                 mangroves and seagrass beds) (Heileman and Mahon, 2008). Around 75 percent of the
                                 waters of this LME are deeper than 1 800 m. Considering the extent of coral reef areas and
                                 the endemic nature of most associated species, the Caribbean Sea LME is an important
                                 global biodiversity hotspot (Miloslavich et al., 2010). The fisheries of the Caribbean LME
                                 are mainly small-scale, with relatively small industrial (mostly trawlers and longliners)
                                 and recreational sectors. Significant fisheries resources include reef-associated species
                                 such as the Caribbean spiny lobster (Panulirus argus), queen conch (Aliger gigas) and reef
                                 fishes (snappers and groupers), small coastal pelagics such as round sardinella (Sardinella
                                 aurita), highly migratory species such as tunas and billfishes, as well as continental shelf
                                 demersal fishes (especially from the family Sciaenidae) and invertebrates (penaeid shrimps
                                 and blue crab).
                                 2.4 The North Brazil Shelf large marine ecosystem
                                 Area 31 includes the northern half of the North Brazil shelf LME. This corresponds
                                 largely with what is known as the Guianas marine ecoregion (Spalding et al., 2007),
                                 which mainly includes the waters of French Guiana, Guyana, Suriname, and Trinidad
                                 and Tobago. This ecoregion extends from the Gulf of Paria between the Bolivarian
                                 Republic of Venezuela and the island of Trinidad, to the limits between French Guiana
                                 and Brazil around 4°12´ north latitude. The ecoregion extends over about 136 000 km2 ,
                                 of which approximately 97 percent is continental shelf area. Primary productivity is
                                 relatively high, with annual values above 300 g/cm2 . This high productivity is related to
                                 an influx of nutrient-rich waters from the Amazon River to the south, as well as inputs
                                 from smaller local rivers such as the Maroni, Corentyne, Demerara and Essequibo. The
                                 fishing fleet is mainly small-scale, but there is an important industrial sector composed
                                 mostly of shrimp trawlers. Major exploited groups include groundfish such as several
                                 species of weakfishes (family Sciaenidae), sea catfishes (family Ariidae) and southern red
                                 snapper (Lutjanus purpureus), penaeid shrimp species, especially the Atlantic seabob
                                 (Xiphopenaeus kroyeri), and coastal pelagic fishes such as king mackerel and Serra Spanish
                                 mackerel (Scomberomorus brasiliensis).

                                 In Area 31, FAO has traditionally evaluated the status of 40 species or species groups,
                                 which include around 50 individual stocks. The status of these stocks is discussed at the
                                 biennial meetings of the Western Central Atlantic Fishery Commission (WECAFC),
                                 after review and comments from the Scientific Advisory Group.

   In this report, the reference list of stocks for Area 313 has been updated according
to the updated methodology to cover 51 species or species groups and 103 stock units

3.2 Classification of the status of stocks
Overall, of the 103 stocks assessed for Area 31, 62.1 percent are sustainably fished while
37.9 percent are unsustainably fished. More specifically, 37.9 percent are considered
underfished, 24.3 percent are considered maximally sustainably fished, and 37.9 percent
are considered overfished (TABLE D.3.2). When weighted by landings, the percentage of
sustainably fished stocks increases to 75.8 percent.

  The stocks for Area 31 have also been classified by tiers, according to the updated meth-
odology.4 For the stocks classified as Tier 1, the information gathered covered 35 species
and 58 stock units. The results from the Tier 1 stock assessments indicated that 12 stocks

Western Central Atlantic




                                 of Tier 1 stocks were sustainably fished and 32.8 percent were not sustainably fished.
                                    A total of 25 species representing a total of 45 assessed stocks were identified for Tier 2.
                                 Most of these stock units were defined by the jurisdictional waters of the reporting coun-
                                 tries. Of the 44 stocks analysed in Tier 2 using production models (SRAplus),5 13 were
                                 maximally sustainably fished, 12 were underfished and 20 were overfished. Hence, for
                                 Tier 2 stocks in Area 31, about 55.6 percent were sustainably fished and 44.4 percent
                                 were not sustainably fished.
                                    Overall, landings of Tier 1 and Tier 2 assessed stocks in Area 31 represented approxi-
                                 mately 72.1 percent of total landings reported in the Western Central Atlantic in 2021
                                 (TABLE D.3.3), a slight increase from 69.9 percent coverage by previous coverage. Total
                                 landings of non-assessed stocks were estimated to represent about 27.9 percent of total
                                 landings reported in Area 31 in 2021.

                                 4. KEY SELECTED SPECIES AND GROUPS
                                 The early years of the series (1950s to 1970s) reflect the period of development for most
                                 commercial fisheries in Area 31, during which landings increased more or less constantly
                                 from around 500 000 tonnes in 1950 to peak at around 2.5 million tonnes in 1984;
                                 since then, landings have shown a more or less decreasing overall trend, reaching around
                                 1.2 million tonnes in 2021 (FIGURE D.3.3). Most of the variability observed in the data
                                 is associated with ISSCAAP group 35 (herrings, sardines and anchovies), which made
                                 up on average 44 percent of total landings during the period 1950–2021 (FAO, 2024a).

                                 4.1 PELAGIC FISH
                                 Pelagic fisheries are the most important fisheries in terms of landed catch in the Western
                                 Central Atlantic. These include species of finfish of the families Clupeidae (sardines,
                                 menhadens and herrings), Scombridae (tunas, mackerels and bonitos), Carangidae (jacks,
                                 scads and pompanos) and Istiophoridae (billfishes), among others. Small pelagic fishes
                                 are caught mainly with purse seines and beach seines, while large and medium-sized
                                 pelagics are caught with purse seines, pelagic longlines, handlines, pole and line, and
                                 surface gillnets.
                                 4.1.1 Small pelagic fish
                                 The main small pelagic fishes are Gulf menhaden (Brevoortia patronus) and round sard-
                                 inella (Sardinella aurita). The fishery for Gulf menhaden is an industrial purse seine
                                 fishery in the northern Gulf of Mexico. The United States is the only country that reports

landings of this species, which is used mainly for fishmeal, oil and, to a much lesser extent,
fish bait. This is the single most important fishery in Area 31, and reached maximum
landings of around one million tonnes in 1984. Since then, landings have decreased
significantly, reaching about 361 000 tonnes in 2021. The decrease in landings is mainly
related to economic factors, given that the stock is not overfished nor giving indications
of overfishing (SEDAR, 2018).
Traditionally, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has been the main producer of round
sardinella in the Western Central Atlantic, with more than 99 percent of total landings in
2021. The fishery is a coastal artisanal fishery operating with beach seines and purse seines.
National legislation establishes that landings are exclusively for human consumption;
they reached a maximum of around 200 000 tonnes in 2004. Since then, landings have
decreased substantially, and total landings in 2021 were estimated to be 90 000 tonnes.
   In the eastern Caribbean, there is a traditional fishery that mainly targets the four-
wing flyingfish (Hirundichthys affinis) using surface gillnets and other accessory gears
(fish aggregating devices and handheld dip nets). Flyingfish are primarily used for human
consumption and as bait fish. Reported landings of flyingfish NEI peaked in 1988 at
around 6 000 tonnes, and had decreased to just over 250 tonnes in 2021, with Barbados
as the major producer. The recent reduction in landings has been associated with reduced
catchability due to Sargassum influxes (Ramlogan et al., 2017; Oxenford et al., 2019). The
population of flyingfish in the eastern Caribbean is considered a unit stock, but adequate
data are lacking to determine stock status (CRFM, 2019).
   The status of these stocks range from underfished to overfished, with stocks in the
southern part of Area 31 overfished and maximally sustainably fished in the Gulf of
Mexico.
4.1.2 Large and medium pelagic fish
In many countries of the region, small-scale fisheries and semi-industrial fisheries, using
longlines, trolling and surface gillnets, target large and medium pelagic fish species. Large
highly migratory species such as blue marlin (Makaira nigricans) and Atlantic sailfish

                                 (Istiophorus albicans) are frequently caught as bycatch in tuna longline fisheries, while
Western Central Atlantic




                                 swordfish (Xiphias gladius) is targeted by a directed longline fishery. In the Greater and
                                 Lesser Antilles, moored fish aggregating devices are used by small-scale fishers to enhance
                                 the catch of large and medium pelagic fishes (Wilson et al., 2020).
                                    A total of 14 countries, mainly from the Lesser Antilles, reported landings of Atlantic
                                 sailfish, but the main producers in 2021 were the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,
                                 Panama and the Dominican Republic. Landings for this species peaked in 2006 at around
                                 1 700 tonnes and have since declined, reaching 787 tonnes in 2021. Around 16 coun-
                                 tries reported landings of blue marlin in 2021, of which France (including Guadeloupe
                                 and Martinique) and Saint Lucia were the main producers. Landings of this species have
                                 shown a decreasing trend since a recent maximum of around 1 900 tonnes in 2008, reach-
                                 ing about 532 tonnes in 2021. A total of 17 countries reported swordfish landings in 2021,
                                 of which the main producers were the United States and Spain. Reported landings for
                                 swordfish have declined steadily since a recent maximum in 2007 of around 5 000 tonnes,
                                 amounting to around 1 070 tonnes in 2021.
                                    Tuna species are mainly exploited by longline, purse seine, and pole and line indus-
                                 trial fisheries in the Western Central Atlantic region. There are also semi-industrial and
                                 small-scale vessels that target tuna species using longlines, handlines and surface gill-
                                 nets. Twenty-nine countries report landings of yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) in
                                 the Western Central Atlantic, of which Brazil, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,
                                 Trinidad and Tobago, and Grenada are the main producers. After peaking at about
                                 40 000 tonnes in 2018, reported landings decreased to about 32 000 tonnes in 2021.
                                 The increase observed since 2012 is mainly due to reported landings by Brazil, which has
                                 become the major producer in the region. For bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) landings have
                                 increased significantly since 2010: after peaking at about 9 200 tonnes in 2016, landings
                                 reached approximately 8 200 tonnes in 2021, mainly due to reports from Brazil and, to a
                                 lesser extent, China, Colombia, Panama, Taiwan Province of China and the Republic of
                                 Korea. The contribution from skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) has decreased signif-
                                 icantly from a maximum of around 21 000 tonnes in 1984 to less than 3 700 tonnes in
                                 2021, mainly from Brazil and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. Landings of black-
                                 fin tuna (Thunnus atlanticus) have also decreased significantly after peaking in 1992 at
                                 around 5 500 tonnes, reaching about 910 tonnes in 2021, with Cuba and Saint Lucia as
                                 the major producers. Reports for albacore (Thunnus alalunga) reached a maximum of
                                 around 11 000 tonnes in 2001 and later decreased to about 3 600 tonnes in 2021, with
                                 Taiwan Province of China, the Dominican Republic and China as major producers.
                                    Migratory coastal pelagic species are exploited commercially mainly by semi-in-
                                 dustrial and small-scale fisheries using handlines and surface gillnets. King
                                 mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla) is exploited in the southeastern United States, the
                                 Gulf of Mexico, the southeastern Caribbean along the coasts of the Bolivarian Republic
                                 of Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago, the Guianas-Brazil shelf, and to a lesser extent in
                                 the eastern Caribbean, especially in Dominica. Total reported landings reached around
                                 13 000 tonnes in 2004 and have subsequently decreased to 4 100 tonnes in 2021. In
                                 decreasing order, the main producers are the United States, the Dominican Republic,
                                 Trinidad and Tobago, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, and Mexico. Atlantic
                                 Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus maculatus) is mainly exploited along the southeast
                                 Atlantic coast of the United States and across the entire extent of the Gulf of Mexico.
                                 Landings showed a recent peak of about 11 000 tonnes in 2018 and then decreased to
                                 3 800 tonnes in 2021, with Mexico as the main producer (around 54 percent of total
                                 landings). The Serra Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus brasiliensis) is exploited mainly
                                 by Trinidad and Tobago and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. Reported data show
                                 a continuous decline from around 7 500 tonnes in 1991 to around 1 600 tonnes in 2021.
                                 Common dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus) is exploited throughout the Western
                                 Central Atlantic, with reported landings from 21 countries. The main producers are
                                 France (including Guadeloupe and Martinique), the Dominican Republic, Saint Lucia
PART D.3 ■ Regional Overview ■ Area 31: Western Central Atlantic                               107




and Barbados. Landings show a continuous increase until 2011 when around 7 000 tonnes
were reported, and a subsequent decline to 3 200 tonnes in 2021.
  Large and medium pelagic stocks in Area 31 are primarily maximally sustainably fished.
4.2 DEMERSAL CONTINENTAL SHELF SPECIES
4.2.1 Invertebrates
Different species of penaeid shrimps are the target of industrial trawl fisheries in Area
31, and to a lesser extent of small-scale trawl and fyke net fisheries in coastal areas. The
most important fisheries are found in the Gulf of Mexico and along the Guianas-Brazil
shelf. Northern brown shrimp (Penaeus aztecus) is reported by Mexico and the United
States, the latter representing 70 percent of total landings in 2021. Reported landings for
this species peaked in 1990 at around 79 000 tonnes and have declined to approximately
44 700 tonnes in 2021. Northern white shrimp (Litopenaeus setiferus) is reported by the
United States, as the major producer (representing 97.7 percent of catches), and Mexico.
Landings of this species show a declining trend in recent years from around 67 000 tonnes
in 2006 to about 51 000 tonnes in 2021. Northern pink shrimp (Penaeus duorarum)
is reported to FAO by the United States, Mexico and Cuba. Landings peaked in the
late 1970s and early 1980s at above 20 000 tonnes; they have since decreased to about
6 900 tonnes in 2021. Atlantic seabob (Xiphopenaeus kroyeri) is reported by Guyana,
Suriname, Mexico, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Colombia and the United
States, with Guyana and Suriname as the main producers with around 90 percent of total
landings. After a sharp increase during the 1980s and 1990s, landings of Atlantic seabob
reached a recent maximum above 30 000 tonnes between 2016 and 2018. However, they
have since declined to about 18 000 tonnes in 2021. Other penaeid shrimps are reported
by 10 countries from the Western Central Atlantic, specifically from the Gulf of Mexico,
Central America (Honduras and Nicaragua) and the Guianas ecoregion (French Guiana,
Guyana, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago). Landings of penaeus shrimps NEI in
Area 31 reached more than 60 000 tonnes in the early 1970s, but since then have shown
a sharp decline to just above 4 300 tonnes in 2021.
   Assessed stocks of demersal continental shelf invertebrates in Area 31 are primarily
sustainably maximally fished or underfished.
4.2.2 Groundfishes
Weakfishes, drums and croakers are members of the family Sciaenidae that are abun-
dant and widely distributed along the continental shelves of Area 31. Weakfishes NEI
(Cynoscion spp.) include several species that are mainly reported by French Guiana,
Mexico and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. This group reached a peak in 1995
of around 20 000 tonnes, subsequently declining steadily to less than 3 200 tonnes
in 2021. The whitemouth croaker (Micropogonias furnieri) is reported only by the
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, and landings peaked in the early to mid-1990s at
around 7 000 tonnes. In recent years, landings have decreased to less than 3 000 tonnes.
The spotted weakfish (Cynoscion nebulosus) is reported mainly by Mexico and, to a much
lesser extent, by the United States. Landings peaked in the late 1990s at 6 700 tonnes, and
have since declined significantly to around 400 tonnes in 2021. Landings of sea catfishes
in Area 31 reached a maximum of around 27 000 tonnes in 1995, but have declined
significantly since 2006 and were at less than 8 500 tonnes in 2021. Most of the landings
in recent years have been reported by Mexico and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,
representing about 95 percent of the total. Overall, the groundfishes in Area 31 range
from maximally sustainably fished to overfished, with most being overfished.
4.3 REEF-ASSOCIATED SPECIES
4.3.1 Invertebrates
The most valuable invertebrate resources exploited in reef-associated habitats in the
Western Central Atlantic are the Caribbean spiny lobster (Panulirus argus) and the
31                         108                                                       Review of the state of world marine fishery resources




                                 queen conch (Aliger gigas). Fisheries for these species are small-scale, semi-industrial or
Western Central Atlantic




                                 industrial using free diving, or diving with SCUBA or Hookah diving gear. Traps and
                                 “casitas” (artificial dwellings) are also used for the capture of Caribbean spiny lobster.
                                    The Caribbean spiny lobster is reported by 26 countries and overseas territories in Area
                                 31. Landings peaked in 1999 at about 36 000 tonnes and have since declined to about
                                 23 400 tonnes in 2021. The Bahamas, Cuba, Honduras, Nicaragua, the Dominican
                                 Republic and the United States accounted for 88 percent of total reported landings in
                                 2021. These stocks are primarily underfished and maximally sustainably fished, with one
                                 stock unit overfished.
                                    Queen conch landings are reported by 21 countries in the Western Central Atlantic.
                                 Total reported landings reached approximately 40 000 tonnes in 1994 and have decreased to
                                 around 36 000 tonnes in 2021. Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Belize, the Dominican
                                 Republic, Honduras, Jamaica, Nicaragua and the Turks and Caicos Islands are the main
                                 regional producers, accounting for 90 percent of total regional landings in 2021. Mainland
                                 associated stocks are about equally distributed between underfished, maximally sustainably
                                 fished and overfished, while most Caribbean islands stocks are underfished.
                                 4.3.2 Finfishes
                                 Finfish species associated with coral reef habitats are highly appreciated and valuable
                                 fish for human consumption. Relevant species are members of the families Lutjanidae
                                 (snappers and jobfishes) and Serranidae (groupers, seabasses and hinds), among others.
                                 These are mainly exploited by small-scale and semi-industrial fisheries using hook and
                                 line gear (demersal longlines and handlines) and traps. Some species are also caught as
                                 bycatch of the industrial shrimp trawl fisheries in the region.
                                    Around 26 countries report individual species or species groups of snappers in the
                                 Western Central Atlantic, with total landings for this taxonomic group reaching a
                                 maximum of around 41 000 tonnes in 1994 and fluctuating around 28 000 tonnes in
                                 recent years (2017–2021). Among the most important species, the northern red snapper
                                 (Lutjanus campechanus) is reported by Mexico and the United States. Landings have
                                 increased since 2012 and in recent years (2018–2021) have been around 8 500 tonnes.
                                 Yellowtail snapper (Ocyurus chrysurus) is reported by 13 countries in Area 31, of which
                                 the main producers are Mexico, the United States and the Dominican Republic. Landings
                                 of yellowtail snapper have decreased in recent years from 5 400 tonnes in 2018 to about
                                 2 200 tonnes in 2021. Landings of vermilion snapper (Rhomboplites aurorubens) are
                                 reported mainly by Mexico, the United States and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela;
                                 they have been increasing since the early 2000s, reaching approximately 3 800 tonnes in
                                 2021. The southern red snapper (Lutjanus purpureus) is reported mainly by Cuba, the
                                 Dominican Republic, Guyana, Suriname and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,
                                 with total landings estimated at around 5 000 tonnes in 2021. Lane snapper (Lutjanus
                                 synagris) is reported by seven countries in Area 31, of which Cuba is the main producer.
                                 Landings of this species peaked in the early 1970s at approximately 4 600 tonnes, and in
                                 recent years (2018–2021) have remained relatively stable at around 1 400 tonnes.
                                    Landings of the family Serranidae, which includes groupers, hinds and seabasses, are
                                 reported by 20 countries and overseas territories in Area 31. Landings of this taxonomic
                                 group reached a maximum of about 33 000 tonnes in 1981 and have since decreased,
                                 reaching around 17 400 tonnes in 2021. The red grouper (Epinephelus morio) is one of
                                 the main species of groupers landed in the Western Central Atlantic. However, only the
                                 United States, including the United States Virgin Islands, and the Dominican Republic
                                 make specific reports for it, with the United States accounting for 93 percent of the
                                 total. Landings in recent years have decreased from 3 000 tonnes in 2014 to around
                                 1 700 tonnes in 2021. Mexico also supports a large fishery for red grouper in the southern
                                 Gulf of Mexico. However, landings are likely reported in the groupers NEI denomination
                                 that reached around 6 000 tonnes in 2021.
                                    Overall, reef-associated finfishes in Area 31 range from maximally sustainably fished
                                 to overfished, with most being overfished.

4.4 RECREATIONAL FISHERIES
In the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, marine recreational fisheries are an impor-
tant component of the leisure and tourism industries. However, except for in the United
States where data are systematically collected, information on the ecological, social and
economic impacts of recreational fisheries is rather limited.
   Recreational fisheries are particularly important in the Gulf of Mexico and along
the southeastern coast of the United States. Activities related to recreational fisheries
generated around 224 000 jobs in 2018 in the United States, representing 48 percent
of all marine recreational fisheries jobs for the country (National Marine Fisheries
Service, 2021). The state of Florida is where most of this activity occurs, with more than
126 000 jobs created. In 2018, there were an estimated 193.5 million marine recrea-
tional fishing trips in the United States, and 68 percent of them were made in Area 31.
The estimated total economic impact associated with marine recreational fisheries on
the southeast coast and in the Gulf of Mexico of the United States was USD 49.5 billion.
   The total harvest of finfishes by marine recreational fisheries in the United States in
FAO Major Fishing Area 31 was 82 000 tonnes in 2021 (NOAA Fisheries, 2025). A selec-
tion of pelagic species – including blackfin tuna, yellowfin tuna, little tunny (Euthynnus
alletteratus), Atlantic bonito (Sarda sarda), king mackerel, Atlantic Spanish mackerel,
cero (Scomberomorus regalis), common dolphinfish, bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix),
greater amberjack (Seriola dumerili), crevalle jack (Caranx hippos), blue runner (Caranx
crysos), barracudas (Sphyraena spp.) and wahoo (Acanthocybium solandri) – made up a
recreational harvest of about 25 000 tonnes in 2021. The recreational harvest of pelagic
species such as Atlantic Spanish mackerel, common dolphinfish, bluefish, and little tunny
was greater than the reported commercial landings of the same species for all countries
in the Western Central Atlantic in 2021. On the other hand, selected demersal species
such as the common snook (Centropomus undecimalis), grunts (Haemulon spp.), hogfish
(Lachnolaimus maximus), black drum (Pogonias cromis), red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus),
flathead grey mullet (Mugil cephalus), white mullet (Mugil curema), Gulf kingcroaker
(Menticirrhus littoralis), spotted weakfish, snappers and groupers contributed to a total
harvest by marine recreational fisheries in Area 31 of around 24 000 tonnes in 2021.
   Shallow-water (or “flats”) recreational fisheries, mainly for species such as bonefish (Albula
vulpes), permit (Trachinotus falcatus) and tarpon (Megalops atlanticus), have significantly
developed in the region. For example, the flats fishery for bonefish in the state of Quintana
Roo, Mexico, attracted around 6 000 anglers in 2019 and their activity generated approx-
imately USD 45 million in that year’s fishing season (Palomo and Perez, 2021). In the
Bahamas in 2018, it was estimated that around 31 000 anglers practised bonefish fishing.
This fishery generated around USD 169 million in total benefits for the Bahamas and created
some 8 000 full-time jobs. Expenditures related to flats fishing amounted to approximately
7 percent of total tourist expenditures in the Bahamas in 2018 (Fedler, 2019).
   In the eastern and southern Caribbean, recreational fishing is mainly associated with
deep-water fishing for large and medium-sized pelagic fishes. Data for recreational fish-
eries is sparse, and most of the information is associated with international gamefish
tournaments. In the eastern Caribbean, target species include blue marlin and Atlantic
white marlin (Kajikia albida), Atlantic sailfish, yellowfin tuna, blackfin tuna, king mack-
erel, Atlantic Spanish mackerel and common dolphinfish, among others (Mohammed,
2012). In a recent study in Dominica, Grenada, Saint Lucia, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, it was estimated that a total of 9 168 recreational fish-
ing trips took place annually, which generated expenditures of about USD 6.8 million
(OECS, 2020).

                                 5. KEY FINDINGS
Western Central Atlantic




                                 Over the years, there have been some important changes in the species composition
                                 of landings and the relative importance of different fisheries in Area 31. For example,
                                 Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus) and the calico scallop (Argopecten gibbus) no
                                 longer make a significant contribution to landings in the Area. On the other hand, species
                                 that were not originally considered for assessing the status of fisheries in the region – such
                                 as the common octopus (Octopus vulgaris) and Mexican four-eyed octopus (Octopus
                                 maya), or sea cucumbers – have developed into regionally important fisheries. Hence,
                                 a methodological update was needed to better reflect the current situation for fisheries
                                 and exploited stocks in Area 31. The quality of landings data in the region varies among
                                 countries. Taxonomic resolution or adequate coverage of different fleet components may
                                 depend on the importance of fisheries to national economies, the resources allocated
                                 for their monitoring, and the available technical capacities. Given the difficulties often
                                 associated with implementation of sampling programmes for small-scale fisheries, data
                                 from industrial fisheries is likely to be more reliable than data from small-scale fisheries.
                                 Also, data on valuable, export-oriented fisheries resources, such as Caribbean spiny lobster
                                 (Panulirus argus) and queen conch (Aliger gigas), is also likely to be more reliable than
                                 fisheries data for less valuable species. Nevertheless, there have overall been improvements
                                 through the years in the taxonomic resolution of species landed. For example, the volume
                                 of landings reported to FAO as marine fishes NEI (not elsewhere included) has decreased
                                 from over 320 000 tonnes in the early 1990s to around 104 000 tonnes in 2021, while
                                 there has been an increase in the number of individual species reported (FAO, 2024a).
                                 For adequate assessments of Tier 2 stocks, the quality of landings data provided to FAO,
                                 along with the availability of reliable estimates of effort or an index of abundance (catch
                                 per unit effort or surveys), are key for unbiased estimates using production-type models.
                                    Overall, the results on the resource status for stocks in Area 31 indicate that, in 2021,
                                 62.1 percent of stocks were sustainably fished (that is, with biomass above 80 percent of
                                 their estimated BMSY values) and 37.9 percent were not sustainably fished. These results,
                                 which cover a larger proportion of the stocks and fisheries in Area 31 than previously
                                 assessed, reflect an improved stock status when compared results from the previous meth-
                                 odology that indicated that 58 percent of stocks were sustainably fished and 42 percent
                                 were not sustainably fished in 2021 (FAO, 2024c). When weighted by landings, the
                                 proportion of sustainably fished stocks increases significantly to 78.0 percent. However,
                                 compared to the results under the previous methodology, the percentage of sustainably
                                 fished stocks weighted by landings has decreased due to the addition of a number of new
                                 assessment units (TABLE D.3.5).
                                    In Area 31, Tier 1 stocks represent around 46.3 percent of total landings, which is simi-
                                 lar to percentages reported at the global level (Hilborn et al., 2020). An improvement with
                                 the new approach is the increase in the total volume of landings evaluated, representing
                                 72.1 percent of total landings reported for Area 31 compared to 69.9 percent under the
                                 previous methodology. Results also indicate that Tier 1 shows a smaller percentage of
                                 overfished stocks (32.8 percent) when compared to Tier 2 stocks (44.4 percent), which is
                                 indicative of better management practices for assessed stocks (Hilborn et al., 2020). Many
                                 of the stocks in Area 31 are shared (Arocha et al., 2024); as such, increased and more effi-
                                 cient international cooperation is necessary to improve the status of stocks in the region.
                                    To conclude, the fisheries sector and marine habitats in the Western Central Atlantic
                                 are under pressure from diverse sources, including the deterioration of coral reef habitats
                                 from, among other factors, fisheries exploitation, coastal runoff, viral diseases, and ocean
                                 warming (Jackson et al., 2014; Shantz et al., 2020; Harms-Tuohy, 2021; Souter et al.,
                                 2021; UNEP-CEP, 2021; Alvarez-Filip et al., 2022; Bove et al., 2022); and the economic
                                 and environmental impact of Sargassum influxes that have been occurring regularly
                                 since 2011 (Wang et al., 2019; WECAFC, 2023). Additionally, pressures from illegal,
                                 unreported and unregulated fishing (FAO, 2021), as well as coastal and marine pollution

including marine litter and microplastics (UNEP-CEP, 2019; UNEP-CEP, 2020), also
impact the fisheries sector. These issues, as well as the transboundary nature of many of
the regional fishery resources, need to be better integrated into the national and regional
management of marine fisheries in the Western Central Atlantic within the context of
an ecosystem approach to fisheries management.

  Area 31 is notably heterogeneous in geographic, ecological, political,
   economic and cultural terms.
  The Western Central Atlantic, especially the Caribbean Sea, harbours
   the highest species diversity in the Atlantic Ocean and represents a
   global hotspot of marine biodiversity.
  Many Small Island Developing States depend on fisheries for national
   and local income, and for food security.
  This Area is experiencing more frequent and severe extreme events
   (e.g. higher intensity hurricanes) due to ocean warming.

1. OVERVIEW
The Eastern Central Atlantic, designated by FAO as Major Fishing Area 34 (hereafter,
Area 34), includes waters off the west coast of Africa, from Cape Spartel to the Congo
River, and covers 14.2 million km2 , of which 0.65 million km2 are shelf area, with exclu-
sive economic zones (EEZs) of 24 countries and territories (FAO, 2024a). The region
encompasses temperate, tropical and equatorial waters, lagoons and mangroves, as well
as oceanographic features such as major currents, upwellings and equatorial convergence.
More than 550 species were reported in fisheries landings taken by coastal states and by

Eastern Central Atlantic




                                 (FAO, 2024c). The fleets operating in the Area are very diverse, including industrial
                                 and artisanal boats of different types (e.g. trawlers, longliners, seiners, dugout canoes)
                                 operating in coastal and offshore areas and using multiple types of gears (e.g. nets, lines,
                                 traps). It is estimated that more than 400 000 vessel units operate in the Area.The fisheries
                                 in Area 34 are diverse, and many of them are typically multispecies, thus posing several
                                 challenges for assessment and management. Since the 1950s, these fisheries have evolved
                                 considerably. Although small pelagic species dominate the landings, representing over
                                 40 percent of total nominal catches in 2021 (FAO, 2024c), the region also hosts a range of
                                 important demersal resources. In terms of capture production, the 2021 catches continued
                                 the upward trend observed since the 1970s, mainly due to the increase in catches of sardine
                                 (also known as European pilchard, Sardina pilchardus). The highest catches are taken in
                                 the northern part of Area 34 (north of Guinea-Bissau), with Morocco and Mauritania
                                 as the main producers. These two countries are also among the world’s top 25 capture
                                 fisheries producers (FAO, 2024b).
                                    To cope with emerging changes, ensure sustainable management of these resources and
                                 respond to Area 34 countries’ request for sustainable use of marine resources, FAO estab-
                                 lished a regional fishery advisory body in 1967, the Fisheries Committee for the Eastern
                                 Central Atlantic (CECAF) (FAO, 1968). The CECAF mandate is to promote the sustain-
                                 able utilization of living marine resources through a science-based approach to fisheries
                                 management frameworks and fishing operations (FAO, 2022a). The CECAF is supported
                                 by a Scientific Sub-Committee. The main function of the Scientific Sub-Committee is
                                 to provide appropriate science-based advice to the Committee for fisheries management
                                 decisions. For this purpose, five working groups collate and improve data and informa-
                                 tion about the fisheries resources and conduct assessments to analyse the state of fisheries
                                 and fish stocks.

                                 2. FISHERY PROFILES
                                 The Eastern Central Atlantic accounted for 6.4 percent of global marine capture fisheries
                                 production in 2021 (80.3 million tonnes) (FAO, 2024b). The landings from Area 34 have
                                 gradually increased since the 1950s, peaking in 2021 (at around 5.2 million tonnes) after
                                 some fluctuation in the 1990–2009 period (Figure 2; FAO 2024b,c). Over the last decade,
                                 the average landings were around 4.8 million tonnes per year. While Angola officially
                                 falls under Area 47, Angola’s landings are included in this figure because some stocks
                                 are shared with countries to the north and are therefore jointly assessed under CECAF.
                                 The exploited fisheries resources include coastal and offshore pelagic resources, as well as
                                 shelf, slope and deep-sea demersal resources, with different bioecological characteristics
                                 and socioeconomic importance. Coastal pelagic resources are the most abundant and
                                 constituted over 50 percent of landings in 2021, with the dominant species being sardine
                                 (Sardina pilchardus), sardinellas (including round sardinella [Sardinella aurita] and flat
                                 sardinella [also known as Madeiran sardinella, Sardinella maderensis]), Cunene horse
                                 mackerel (Trachurus trecae) and bonga shad (Ethmalosa fimbriata). The catch in the
                                 north of Area 34 is generally larger than in the south (from Guinea-Bissau to the mouth
                                 of the Congo river), and Morocco and Mauritania are among the largest producers. The
                                 proportion of catches originating from artisanal fisheries has varied over time and by
                                 subregion. Data provided by the CECAF working groups indicate that the percentage of
                                 catches originating from artisanal fisheries is lower in the north than in the south (FAO,
                                 2022b, 2023a,b, 2024d).
                                    Distant-water fishing nations have been operating in Area 34 since the early 1950s,
                                 with peaks in catches recorded in the 1970s and in the late 1980s–1990s. Subsequently,
                                 market forces and changes in management regimes resulted in a reduction in the activities
                                 of some distant-water fleets that were mainly targeting small pelagic fish, which in turn
                                 led to a considerable drop in catches. Since 1996, fishing effort by foreign fleets on small
                                 pelagics has increased in the northwest portion of Area 34. Although there have been

some fluctuations, catches have remained relatively stable since that time. Other foreign
fleets are also active in Area 34, targeting shrimp, cephalopods and demersal fish. Coastal
states have steadily developed their national fisheries, increasing their contribution from
less than 50 percent to over 80 percent of total catches in Area 34 between the 1970s and
the 2020s. In part, this trend can also be associated with the reflagging of some foreign
vessels under the national flags. Since 2003, coastal states have contributed between
75 percent and 80 percent of the reported catches (FAO, 2011).
   A lack of adequate fisheries-related and biological data is a matter of concern in
the region. The CECAF assessment working groups that operate under the Scientific
Sub-Committee highlight that for several of the stocks assessed, a lack of adequate data
make it hard to assess the state of stocks using standard methods. In particular, for several
artisanal/small-scale fisheries and semi-industrial fisheries, time series of catch and effort
or more detailed information (e.g. biological data, length/age data) are not available,
thus limiting the assessments of stocks that are exploited by such fleets (FAO, 2022b).
In addition, while some of the large industrial fisheries have high-quality catch informa-
tion on target species, non-target species are poorly recorded. Moreover, for many stocks,
fisheries-independent data are missing or scattered over time and it is difficult to define
a reliable series of catch per unit effort to use as an index of abundance.
   In consequence, scientific advice in support of the management of most stocks is based
on a precautionary approach, in line with the high uncertainty in data and assessment
results. In recent years, CECAF has therefore started exploring the use of alternative,
more flexible tools, including tools for data-poor fisheries, in order to improve scientific
advice and management recommendations.

3. RESOURCE STATUS
This review is based on the results of the most recent assessments of the state of the main
fisheries resources undertaken by CECAF working groups. The list of stocks assessed by
CECAF was complemented with the results of a regional consultation organized by FAO
(Banjul, the Gambia, 16–19 May 2023) which aimed to provide a more comprehensive
overview of the status of fisheries resources in Area 34 (APPENDIX II, TABLE 4 , pp. 424),
following the revised methodology adopted for the global stock status overview (PART B,
METHODOLOGY, pp 6). The updated methodology classifies stocks into tiers based on
the availability and quality of information for each stock (Tier 1, Tier 2 or Tier 3).
Information on the status of 133 stocks was compiled for Area 34 (TABLE D.4.1), repre-
senting a total of 63 species.

                                    Of the stocks assessed, 77 are classified as Tier 1 (assessed using formal stock assess-
Eastern Central Atlantic




                                 ments through CECAF working groups) and 56 are classified as Tier 2 (stocks for which
                                 CECAF working groups could not provide any information and the status of which was
                                 inferred through catch data and auxiliary effort data) (TABLE D.4.2). No stock from Area
                                 34 currently falls under Tier 3 (stocks for which data is insufficient for Tier 1 or Tier 2
                                 and whose state is categorized using a model-free approach, based on indicators derived
                                 from scientific and non-scientific information [e.g. expert consultations, market data
                                 or local knowledge]). Overall, landings of Tier 1 and Tier 2 assessed stocks in Area 34
                                 represented 71.6 percent of total landings reported in Area 34 in 2021, an increase from
                                 64.1 percent covered by the previous methodology.
                                    While CECAF uses a specific terminology for stock status classification, for the sake
                                 of harmonization across the chapters of this report, the stock status terminology refers to
                                 “overfished” (instead of overexploited), “maximally sustainably fished” (instead of fully
                                 exploited) and “underfished” (instead of non-fully exploited).
                                    The revised list of stocks and their respective status show that the majority of the stocks
                                 analysed in Area 34 were found to be overfished (52.6 percent). The proportion of stocks
                                 that are maximally sustainably fished is 30.8 percent, with 16.5 percent underfished.

4. KEY SELECTED SPECIES AND GROUPS
The FAO CECAF working groups on demersal resources and on small pelagic fish conduct
assessments and report on stock status by subareas – Area 34 North and South1 – based
on what scientific advice for management is provided and which recommendations for
future research are formulated. The sections below provide an overview of the stock status
for selected key species or species groups by subareas from the 2022 CECAF working
groups on stock assessment, and reported in the latest The State of World Fisheries and
Aquaculture (SOFIA) report (FAO, 2024b).
4.1 Small pelagic fish – Area 34 North
Sardine (Sardina pilchardus) is one of the most important small-pelagic fisheries resources
in the northern part of Area 34, where three stocks are considered: the northern, the
central and the southern stocks. Furthermore, the Canary Islands stock is considered as
a separate unit from the West African stocks. The catch from the southern stock repre-
sents over 52 percent of the total. As regards the northern and central stocks, more than
99 percent of the fishing is carried out by Moroccan purse seiners, with landings by foreign
coastal purse seiners targeting sardines limited to less than 1 percent. The southern stock
is exploited by a Moroccan fleet composed of purse seiners, RSW2-type pelagic trawlers,
and by a foreign fleet composed of pelagic freezer trawlers and RSW-type trawlers. The
three sardine stocks (with north and central assessed jointly) and the southern stock
were found to be maximally sustainably fished in 2021, with a medium to low level of
uncertainty. In Mauritania, sardine is fished by the artisanal fleet, Mauritanian purse
seiners and foreign fleets.
    Round sardinella (Sardinella aurita) and Madeiran sardinella (Sardinella maderensis)
are often caught together and aggregated under “sardinella” in catch reporting because of
species identification issues. However, disaggregated data available indicate that catches
of Madeiran sardinella were relatively stable until 2019 and have shown fluctuations since

                                 then. Catches of round sardinella have shown an overall decreasing trend since 2014.
Eastern Central Atlantic




                                 Overall, the fishing effort of industrial fleets has decreased, whereas that of artisanal fleets
                                 has increased in recent years.
                                    Both round and flat sardinella stocks undergo intense fishing effort and are in a critical
                                 state, with very low biomass levels. Management arrangements have been put in place by
                                 some countries, but it is too early to see the impacts on the state of the stocks. Scientists
                                 have been persistently calling for the design and implementation of drastic management
                                 measures, such as a substantial reduction in fishing effort and a prohibition on the use of
                                 sardinellas for fish meal, combined with measures to improve the biological productivity
                                 of the stock, such as the protection of spawning and recruitment phases of both species
                                 (since they are exploited together).
                                 4.2 Cephalopods – Area 34 North
                                 The main cephalopod species landed in this area are common octopus (Octopus vulgaris),
                                 cuttlefish (Sepia spp., mainly common cuttlefish [Sepia officinalis], giant African cuttlefish
                                 [Sepia hierredda], and African cuttlefish [Sepia bertheloti]) and European squid (Loligo
                                 vulgaris), with octopus being the dominant species in the landings.
                                    North of Cape Blanc, the octopus fishery has evolved since the 1960s. Initially led by a
                                 Spanish fleet, Moroccan fishing developed alongside the Spanish fleet during the 1970s
                                 and 1980s. Nowadays the fleet is exclusively Moroccan, including freezer trawlers (that
                                 conduct fishing trips of 45–50 days), coastal fresh fishing trawlers (storing fish under ice for
                                 5–6 days during the fishing trips), and small-scale artisanal boats (operating on a day-trip
                                 basis). The artisanal fishery uses mainly passive gears (pots and jigs). The stock sustain-
                                 ing the fishery in this area is referred to as the Dakhla octopus stock, and it is considered
                                 maximally sustainably fished by CECAF.
                                    In Mauritania, octopus fishing was historically carried out by both foreign and local
                                 units. Since 2012, it has been reserved for national segments, with a management strategy
                                 updated in 2016 focusing on quotas and concessions. The artisanal fishery consists mainly
                                 of small boats (<14.5 m length overall and <150 hp engines) fishing with pots. In Senegal
                                 and the Gambia, cephalopods are targeted by both industrial and artisanal multi-species
                                 fisheries. The industrial fleet includes national trawlers, while the artisanal fleet (Senegal)
                                 uses jiggers, traps and trammel nets, mainly for octopus and cuttlefish. While some of the
                                 octopus stocks in the Area are overfished, cuttlefish was found to be underfished in 2021.
                                 4.3 Hake – Area 34 North
                                 In this Area, hake comprises mainly two groups of species: black hakes (Senegalese hake
                                 [Merluccius senegalensis] and Benguela hake [(Merluccius polli]) and white hake (also
                                 known as European hake, Merluccius merluccius). European hake, a temperate species, is
                                 generally abundant in the north of the CECAF zone, but is not normally observed south
                                 of Cap Boujador. South of Cap Blanc, hake catches can be attributed almost exclusively
                                 to black hakes, mostly Senegalese hake and Benguela hake.
                                    Overall, in Area 34 North, hakes are caught by industrial vessels (trawlers and long-
                                 liners) from coastal and foreign fleets in offshore waters. The Moroccan fleet exploiting
                                 white hake is made up of coastal trawlers, longliners, cephalopod freezer boats and arti-
                                 sanal boats. About 10 percent of the artisanal fleet (15 000 boats) fish for white hake,
                                 using longlines, bottom gillnets and handlines. White hake is exclusively exploited by
                                 the coastal fleet operating in the north of the country, whereas black hake is exploited by
                                 all the units, usually together with other species (e.g. cephalopods). In Mauritania, black
                                 hake is targeted by several foreign fleets. In addition, these species constitute a non-neg-
                                 ligible part of bycatch, mainly for pelagic and demersal trawlers, as well as for cephalopod
                                 fishers, shrimp trawlers, and other fleets (black hake bycatch can reach up to 50 percent of
                                 the catches). In Senegal, the fleets exploiting black hake comprise a very limited number
                                 of foreign “glacier” trawlers (vessels preserving their catch in ice), mainly from Spain. In
                                 recent years, three or four Senegalese fishing vessels (freezers and “glaciers”) have started
                                 fishing for black hake. In the Gambia, only three foreign freezer trawlers are currently

authorized to exploit black hake, but they are not active throughout the year. Some of the
hake stocks in Area 34 are considered overfished.
4.4 Shrimps – Area 34 North
The exploitation of crustaceans along the western coast of Africa, from Morocco to
southern Senegal, involves both coastal and deep-water shrimp species. Key species include
the southern pink shrimp (Penaeus notialis), the deep-water rose shrimp (Parapenaeus
longirostris), and the striped red shrimp (Aristeus varidens). Other species like a few
Caramote prawn (Penaeus kerathurus), the blue and red shrimp (Aristeus antennatus),
and Plesionika shrimps (Plesionika spp.) are also caught but are less abundant.
   In Morocco, shrimp species like deep-water rose shrimp and blue and red shrimp are
targeted by various trawlers, including coastal and deep-sea freezer trawlers. The shrimp
fishery operates mainly along the continental shelf, on the slope and in deep waters. The
foreign shrimp fisheries in Morocco ceased in 1999 with the expiration of the fishery
agreement with the European Union, and new agreements after 2006 excluded shrimp
fishing. Thus, the shrimp fishery in Morocco is currently operated by the national fleet.
   Mauritania’s shrimp fishery, involving both national and foreign fleets, saw fluctuating
fleet sizes from 2012 to 2022 due to the terms of regulating agreements, especially with
the European Union. Foreign fleets decreased after 2012, with a slight increase in 2022.
By 2015, Mauritania’s national fleet had dwindled to just one or two vessels, and after
2022 no domestic fishery has been registered as a result of low yields.
   Senegal’s shrimp fishery began with foreign vessels adopting Senegalese nationality in
1982. By 2013, the Senegalese fleet, consisting mainly of deep-sea trawlers, dominated
shrimp fishing. The industrial fleet targeting southern pink shrimp in Senegal decreased
significantly between 2008 and 2023. The artisanal fleet also targets shrimp species,
mainly southern pink shrimp.
   In the Gambia, both artisanal and industrial fisheries target southern pink shrimp. The
artisanal fishery typically operates with canoes and various gears, particularly in estuarine
and brackish waters, while industrial fleets operate larger vessels. Mainly foreign industrial
vessels have a licence to fish shrimps in Gambian waters, often offloading their catches
in foreign ports. A two-year fishing ban from 2015–2016 led to a decline in industrial
vessels, though numbers rose again post-ban until 2021 before declining.
   Finally, the giant tiger prawn (Penaeus monodon), which is an introduced species in
the Area, has been increasingly observed in landings from the Senegal-Gambia region.
More data is needed to understand its distribution and abundance.
   Countries in the region have invested efforts in regulating the ocean shrimp fishery
by putting in place management regulations covering mesh sizes, gears, bycatch rates and
zoning over time and space (closed season and/or closed areas). The state of stocks varies
based on species and areas. While one stock of deep-water rose shrimp was found to be
overfished, others were underfished in the area, with an overall high level of certainty.
Assessments for southern pink shrimp were available only in Senegal and the Gambia,
where the stock is maximally sustainably fished, while striped red shrimp is underfished
in Mauritania.
4.5 Small pelagic fish – Area 34 South
Catches in Area 34 South are primarily dominated by round and flat sardinellas. These
species are found year-round, with catch peaks coinciding with peak upwelling periods.
The CECAF working group for the assessment of small pelagic fish, sub-group South,
has adopted four distinct sardinella species in Area 34 South: northern, western, central
and southern zones, with different species predominant in each.
   In the northern zone (Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia), round sardinella
is primarily caught by industrial pelagic trawlers and as bycatch by demersal trawlers. Flat
sardinella is mostly fished by artisanal canoes using various nets, including gillnets and
beach seines. In the western zone (Ghana, Côte d’Ivoire, Togo, Benin), round sardinella
dominates the catches, with flat sardinella being more common off the coast of Benin.

                                 Both species are mainly fished by the artisanal fleets in Ghana, Togo and Benin and, to
                                 a lesser extent, by the semi-industrial (inshore) fleet and the industrial fish trawlers in
Eastern Central Atlantic




                                 Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire. In the central zone (Nigeria, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea),
                                 round sardinella is the dominant species in Nigeria, while flat sardinella is more abun-
                                 dant in Cameroon. Artisanal fishers use drift gillnets and beach seines, with canoes of
                                 varying sizes equipped with outboard motors. In the southern zone (Gabon, Republic
                                 of Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Angola), artisanal fleets target sardinella
                                 species, while industrial fleets also contribute significantly to the catch. In Gabon and
                                 the Republic of Congo, flat sardinella is the dominant species, whereas round sardinella
                                 is more abundant during specific months. In Angola, flat sardinella is mainly found
                                 inshore, with round sardinella offshore. The industrial pelagic trawling in Angola ceased
                                 in 2004, but the species is still caught using purse seines and artisanal gear. Most of the 12
                                 sardinella stocks are overfished throughout the southern area, while three are maximally
                                 sustainably fished: the northern stock of round sardinella, and the central and southern
                                 stocks of flat sardinella.
                                    Bonga (Ethmalosa fimbriata), an important species in coastal waters, estuaries and
                                 rivers, is mainly fished by artisanal fisheries in Guinea, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Cameroon
                                 and Gabon. As for sardinella, the species is also divided into four stocks: northern, west-
                                 ern, central and southern. In the northern zone, bonga is primarily caught using ring
                                 gillnets, purse seines and beach seines, with canoes ranging 6–18 m and powered by
                                 outboard motors. In the western zone, similar gears are used, and bonga constitutes a
                                 smaller portion of the total landings. In the central zone, bonga is also caught using a
                                 variety of nets, while in the southern zone it is targeted with surface drift gillnets and
                                 purse seines. The western and central stocks are overfished; the northern and southern
                                 ones are maximally sustainably fished.
                                    European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), found throughout Area 34 South, is a
                                 key species in upwelling areas, particularly in shallow coastal waters and estuaries. The
                                 CECAF working group has identified three anchovy stocks: northern, western and south-
                                 ern. Anchovy is caught in large quantities with beach seines and purse seines in Benin,
                                 Ghana and Togo, where it is a significant fishery product, sold separately from other
                                 pelagic species, as it is part of a traditional diet. In other countries like Cameroon, Gabon
                                 and Nigeria, the species is a bycatch, making data collection and monitoring challeng-
                                 ing. In Guinea, anchovy is a bycatch with no commercial value, and it is often discarded.
                                 The northern and the southern European anchovy stocks were found to be maximally
                                 sustainably fished, whereas the western stock is overfished, with a high level of uncertainty.
                                 4.6 Shrimps – Area 34 South
                                 The shrimp fisheries have a high economic value in Area 34 South. They include coastal
                                 and offshore species, and are exploited by artisanal or industrial fleets depending on the
                                 main species’ areas of distribution. Fishing grounds in national waters are exploited both
                                 by national and foreign fleets.
                                    In Guinea-Bissau, industrial trawlers exploit coastal (mainly southern pink shrimp)
                                 and deep-sea (deep-water rose shrimp, striped red shrimp) species, targeted by Spanish
                                 shrimpers or caught as bycatch by Spanish and Chinese demersal trawlers targeting fish
                                 or cephalopods. Coastal shrimps are also captured as bycatch by other trawlers and arti-
                                 sanal canoes, but these fisheries are poorly documented. In Sierra Leone, the industrial
                                 sector accounts for over 75 percent of shrimp production, with the dominant species
                                 being southern pink shrimp, followed by Caramote prawn and deep-water rose shrimp.
                                 The shrimp fishery, mainly operated by industrial foreign vessels predominantly from
                                 China, has had fewer than 15 vessels in recent years, and the number of licences is gradu-
                                 ally decreasing. In Liberia, shrimp fishing targeting mainly southern pink shrimp, Guinea
                                 shrimp (Holthuispenaeopsis atlantica), Caramote prawn and deep-water rose shrimp was
                                 a significant industry until the civil war in the 1990s. Fishing effort targeting shrimp in
                                 recent years has been low to non-existent, and little data is available on the shrimp bycatch
                                 of other fleets. In Ghana, since the closure of the industrial fishery, only the artisanal fleet
                                 continues to catch coastal shrimps (mainly Guinea shrimp) with artisanal purse seines, set

nets and beach seines. In Benin, an artisanal fleet of pirogues and an industrial fleet (fish
and shrimp trawlers) catch several species of shrimps. The industrial fleet is authorized
to fish beyond 5 nautical miles. Both fleets operate under a licensing system and catch
deep-water rose shrimp, Caramote prawn, giant tiger prawn, Guinea shrimp and south-
ern pink shrimp, the bulk of which are for the export market.
   In Nigeria, similarly to other countries, the composition of shrimp catches is domi-
nated by southern pink shrimp, Caramote prawn, giant tiger prawn, Guinea shrimp and
deep-water rose shrimp, exploited by an artisanal fishery within 5 nautical miles of the
coast and an industrial trawling fishery (shrimp and fish trawlers) beyond 5 nautical miles.
There were more than 200 industrial vessels until the 2010s; the number of vessels had
decreased to 150 by 2016. The industrial shrimp fishery accounts for more than 80 percent
of the total landings of all shrimp species.
   In Cameroon, shrimps are also caught by artisanal and industrial fleets, including
foreign vessels operating within 20 nautical miles. In Equatorial Guinea, species caught
are southern pink shrimp, Caramote prawn, giant tiger prawn and Guinea shrimp; as of
2021, when licences to the Chinese industrial fleet were suspended, shrimp species have
been a bycatch of semi-industrial vessels and artisanal canoes. In Gabon, since the entry
into force of the 2013 management plan, only coastal shrimps (southern pink shrimp,
Caramote prawn and Guinea shrimp) are exploited. Recent exploratory fishing of deep-
sea crustaceans was carried out by Spanish trawlers under the fishing agreement between
Gabon and the European Union. In the Congo, deep-water rose shrimp is targeted by
six or fewer Spanish industrial shrimp trawlers, whereas coastal species – southern pink
shrimp and Guinea shrimp – are caught as bycatch by industrial fish trawlers. In the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, an artisanal fishery using gill nets and traps is known
to exert heavy pressure on shrimp species.
   Countries with active shrimp fisheries also include Angola, where the deep-sea shrimp
fishery (catching deep-water rose shrimp and striped red shrimp) is one of the most impor-
tant; it is operated by national trawlers and foreign fleets, including Spanish vessels. A coastal
fishery is also active, operated by semi-industrial vessels targeting southern pink shrimp.
   Assessments are only available for a few stocks: coastal shrimps (several Penaeid species
mixed), southern pink shrimp, deep-water rose shrimp and striped red shrimp. The state
of shrimp resources in Area 34 South is highly variable from one area and species to
another: southern pink shrimp is underfished in Guinea-Bissau and Gabon and maxi-
mally sustainably fished in the Congo, and it is estimated to be overfished in other areas
(albeit with high uncertainty). An overall review of all individual assessments of coastal
shrimps indicates that stocks are overfished. Deep-water rose shrimp was also estimated to
be overfished throughout the south of Area 34, except the Guinea–Guinea-Bissau stock,
which was assessed to be maximally sustainably fished. The stock of striped red shrimp is
assessed as maximally sustainably fished.
4.7 Cephalopods – Area 34 South
In Area 34 South, the bulk of cephalopod landings are comprised of common octopus
and cuttlefish (mainly the giant African cuttlefish).
   In Guinea-Bissau, cephalopods are fished by industrial fleets from foreign countries.
The fishing effort has fluctuated over time ( >100 units since 2014) based on local condi-
tions and the establishment of international agreements. Foreign fleets are composed
mainly of “freezer” demersal trawlers. Domestic artisanal fisheries also exploit cephalopod
stocks, with cuttlefish dominating the catch until 2007 although it has been overtaken
by octopus. In Guinea, cephalopods, mostly cuttlefish, are targeted by industrial and
artisanal fisheries. Industrial foreign fleets began operating in the 1980s, but in 2002
most of them left the fishery, moving to Guinea-Bissau. The cuttlefish stock appears to
be overfished in Guinea-Bissau and underfished in Guinea.
   In Ghana, the cephalopod catch is dominated by cuttlefish, with giant African cuttle-
fish constituting over 90 percent of the total cephalopod catch. This resource is exclusively
targeted by national industrial “freezer” trawlers that run 30-day fishing trips. Assessments
of cuttlefish species in the Area indicate that the stock is overfished

                                 5. KEY FINDINGS
Eastern Central Atlantic




                                 Previous assessments and studies carried out under CECAF have consistently called
                                 for improved management of fisheries resources in Area 34. This updated information
                                 on the state of stocks puts additional emphasis on the urgency to act. The results under
                                 the updated and previous methodology indicate a similar proportion of sustainable and
                                 unsustainable stocks (TABLE D.4.4). Despite the very slight change in percentage, the
                                 majority of stocks continue to be considered overfished, with the situation severe for both
                                 demersal and pelagic species. When weighted by production levels, biologically sustainable
                                 stocks account for 65.6 percent of the 2021 landings of assessed stocks monitored by FAO
                                 (TABLE D.4.5), significantly higher than estimated with previous assessments. Moreover the
                                 coverage of the assessment increased from 64.1 percent with the previous methodology
                                 to 71.6 percent with the current one in 2021.

   Initiatives aimed at addressing the growing concern over the state of the resources in the
region have been undertaken, but stock assessment results clearly indicate that measures
need to be strengthened and scaled up. For example, in terms of recent initiatives, Ghana,
Côte d’Ivoire and Benin invested substantial coordination efforts to plan a common
closed fishing season to address overfishing. In addition, countries like Mauritania have
developed and are implementing management plans for small pelagics, including sard-
inella, which is a key small pelagic species that has been at the core of heated debates related
to fishmeal. Subsequently, with the support of the EAF-Nansen Programme,3 Senegal and
the Gambia have also developed national fisheries management plans for sardinella, and
a similar effort has been initiated in Guinea-Bissau. These national efforts are backed by
the sub-regional “shared sardinella” initiative which aims to ensure consistent manage-
ment practices across the sub-region, given the shared nature of the stock.
   While management advice has been provided over the years by CECAF, the uptake of
the advice by countries and the design and implementation of conservation and manage-
ment measures has been lagging. This was the rationale for developing a series of studies
to understand the bottlenecks that hinder the effective uptake of advice in fisheries
management. An in-depth analysis of the gaps between theoretical recommendations
and their actual uptake by national fisheries management bodies identified a number of
barriers, among which were limited technical capacity, inadequate resources, and a lack
of coordinated efforts between countries.
   While CECAF has an advisory role, offering recommendations to its member states
on fisheries management, countries have expressed a desire for CECAF to strengthen
its role by providing more detailed, actionable and country-specific recommendations
that can be more easily implemented at the national level. In particular, countries have
called for clearer guidelines on managing fisheries that take into account local conditions,
capacities and priorities.
   To address these concerns, technical support is needed to provide more tailored
management frameworks, fostering stronger scientific collaboration, and facilitating
capacity-development programmes. Strengthening regional monitoring and enforcement
systems is also essential to ensure that regulations are upheld.
   Furthermore, increased scientific and policy dialogue among member states can
enhance and strengthen shared responsibility and collective action in managing the
exploitation of marine resources. With a coordinated approach and stronger national
capacities, the CECAF region can work towards achieving long-term sustainability in
its fisheries sector. Given the complexity of the region and the shared nature of fisheries
resources, there is a need to strengthen management practices at the sub-regional level, and
to leverage existing frameworks such as the Fisheries Commission for the West Central
Gulf of Guinea (FCWC), the Sub-regional Fisheries Commission (SRFC) and the Gulf
of Guinea Regional Fisheries Commission (COREP).
   In conclusion, the future of fisheries management in the CECAF area lies in overcom-
ing the barriers to the effective implementation of regulations and recommendations.
By continuing to monitor the state of stocks in a regular manner and by providing more
targeted, detailed guidance, CECAF can assist member states in cooperating in managing
their fisheries in a more sustainable and cooperative manner, ensuring that the ecological,
cultural and economic benefits of fisheries are preserved for future generations.

    In collaboration with 32 countries across Africa and the Bay of Bengal, the EAF-Nansen Programme is committed
    to improving fisheries management in line with the ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF), strengthening the
    capacities of fisheries institutions and generating scientific knowledge on marine resources and ecosystems. The
    Programme is executed by FAO in close collaboration with the Norwegian Institute of Marine Research, funded
    by the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation.

  Illegal fishing and overfishing increase pressures on local resources.
  Climate change is a particular threat to tropical fisheries, especially for
   SSF, due too changes in distribution and abundance.
  Essential fish habitats are threatened by anthropogenic impacts.
  Key to resilience are continued improvements in monitoring,
   enforcement of regulations, and integrated coastal management.

1. OVERVIEW
The Mediterranean and the Black Sea, designated by FAO as Major Fishing Area 37 (hereafter,
Area 37) (FIGURE D.5.1), cover an area of approximately 3 million km2, accounting for 0.8 percent
of the global marine surface. They are situated within a relatively narrow latitudinal range
(30° to 46° north) in the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere. The average depth
is 1 500 m, with the deepest point recorded in the Ionian Sea at about 5 200 m; the Black
Sea reaches a maximum depth of approximately 2 200 m. The continental shelf of Area 37
is mostly narrow (23 percent of the total area), with notable exceptions in the Adriatic
Sea, Gulf of Gabès, Strait of Sicily, Gulf of Lions, the Nile Delta and the northwestern
portion of the Black Sea.

Mediterranean and Black Sea



                                                 The productivity and ecological health of the Mediterranean and the Black Sea are
                                              affected by a combination of regional and global factors, including their semi-enclosed
                                              nature, the region’s status as a climate change hotspot, which facilitates the appearance
                                              and expansion of non-indigenous species, as well as relatively high levels of chemical and
                                              plastic pollution, and the existence of unsustainable fishing practices such as illegal, unre-
                                              ported and unregulated (IUU) fishing and overfishing. Adding to these challenges, the
                                              Mediterranean in particular has seen an exponential increase in competition for space
                                              at sea, including for maritime transport and renewable offshore energy. This trend poses
                                              additional threats to fisheries- and aquaculture-related livelihoods, and adds pressure on
                                              the marine environment.

Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). It is rather unique in the fact
that it is responsible for the conservation and sustainable use of all fishery resources in the
Mediterranean and the Black Seas, with the exception of large migratory species (tunas,
bonitos, billfishes and sharks), whose management is addressed through International
Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), and has the authority
to adopt binding recommendations for fisheries conservation and management and for
aquaculture development. For management purposes, its area of application is divided into
five subregions: the western, central and eastern Mediterranean, the Adriatic Sea and the
Black Sea which are further divided into 30 geographical subareas (GSAs) (FIGURE D.5.2).
   The GFCM provides a comprehensive and up-to-date review of the status and trends
of fisheries in the GFCM area of application through its biennial flagship publication,
The State of Mediterranean and Black Sea Fisheries (SoMFi). SoMFi is based on data
regularly submitted by GFCM member countries and on the most recent information
produced by the GFCM’s scientific bodies, providing an important tool to support strate-
gic decision-making and monitor progress towards the main goals and objectives set by the
GFCM. This chapter is based on the data analysed and published in SoMFi 2023, based
on the reference year 2021 (FAO, 2023), together with additional stock status information
that were sourced from the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14.4.1 questionnaires.

2. FISHERY PROFILES

2.1 Overview
The Mediterranean and the Black Sea have supported significant fisheries activities
since ancient times. At present, the fisheries sector in the region encompasses industrial,
semi-industrial and small-scale operations employing a wide variety of fishing gear. A
characteristic feature of fisheries in Area 37 is the exploitation of highly diverse assem-
blages of fishes, crustaceans and molluscs, which are often potentially associated with
complex stock structuring. Notable exceptions include small pelagic fisheries, which are
prominent in both basins. Furthermore, the geographic setting of these semi-enclosed
seas results in many stocks being shared among fleets from multiple riparian countries.
   These attributes pose important emergent challenges for the assessment and manage-
ment of fisheries in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. The disproportionately high
number of stocks requires robust data collection and additional scientific capacity,
alongside strong regional cooperation. Effective management in the region relies on the
implementation of a combination of diverse measures at the regional level, aligned with
an adaptive approach to multispecies management.
   Fisheries landings in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea have exhibited fluctuating
trends since 1950. Between 1971 and 1988, total capture fisheries production in the region
gradually increased from 1 million tonnes to nearly 2 million tonnes (FIGURES D.5.4A and
D.5.4.B). During the 1980s, total landings remained relatively stable at their peak before
experiencing a decline between 1989 and 1991, primarily due to the collapse of pelagic
fisheries in the Black Sea.
   In 2021, the fisheries sector in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea recorded a total
production of over 1 million tonnes, generating approximately USD 7.8 billion in reve-
nues and providing employment for more than 457 500 individuals across the entire value
chain (FAO, 2023). In recent years, revenues from capture fisheries have shown a modest
increase of 1.3 percent since 2020, while employment has slightly decreased by 5.7 percent,
with the fishing fleet remaining relatively stable.
   In the Mediterranean Sea, landings continued to increase until 1994, reaching approx-
imately 1 million tonnes, after which they decreased to 750 000 tonnes by 2015. The next
three years saw a rise in production, which reached 800 000 tonnes in 2018, but then
dropped sharply to about 670 000 tonnes in 2021. In the Black Sea, landings have fluc-
tuated considerably year to year since 1990. Between 1992 and 1995 there was a generally
increasing trend, followed by a decline from 1996 to 1998, with continued fluctuations
until 2021 when reported landings amounted to around 400 000 tonnes. The decline

Mediterranean and Black Sea



                                    in landings observed in 2020 and 2021 was likely further exacerbated by COVID-19
                                    restrictions, which not only imposed temporary closures on fishing activities but also
                                    resulted in a near-total shutdown of tourism, negatively impacting trade and reducing
                                    demand (GFCM, 2020).
                                    2.2 Fishing capacity
                                    According to the GFCM (FAO, 2023), the capacity of operating fishing vessels in the
                                    Mediterranean and the Black Sea is about 867 400 gross tonnage and 5.407 million
                                    kilowatts (kW). Small-scale vessels account for around 82 percent of the fishing fleet,
                                    with 68 100 fishing vessels, followed by trawlers and beam trawlers (around 6 700 vessels,
                                    8 percent), purse seiners and pelagic trawlers (almost 4 300 vessels, 5 percent), and what
                                    are classified as “other fleet segments” (almost 4 000 vessels, 5 percent). The prevalence of
                                    small-scale vessels is higher in the Black Sea (9 200 vessels, 85 percent of the fleet) than
                                    across the whole GFCM area of application.
                                       In the Mediterranean Sea, small-scale vessels lead the fleet composition in all four subre-
                                    gions, especially in the central and eastern Mediterranean, where they represent 85 percent
                                    of the operating fleet, at 19 600 and 18 800 vessels respectively. Trawlers and beam
                                    trawlers range from 5 percent in the central Mediterranean (1 270 vessels) to 13 percent
                                    in the Adriatic Sea (1 338 vessels). The least-represented vessel group in Mediterranean
                                    subregions (excluding the aggregated group “other fleet segments”) is purse seiners and
                                    pelagic trawlers, which shows a relative peak in the western Mediterranean (12 percent,
                                    1 960 vessels) and contributes particularly low percentages in the central Mediterranean
                                    (3 percent, 680 vessels) and the Adriatic Sea (3 percent, 290 vessels).
                                       Purse seiners and pelagic trawlers are responsible for the largest share of total landings
                                    (58.9 percent) in the GFCM area of application, accounting for 47.7 percent of landings
                                    in the Mediterranean Sea (ranging from 37.2 percent in the central Mediterranean to
                                    58.8 percent in the Adriatic Sea) and 80.1 percent in the Black Sea. Trawlers and beam trawl-
                                    ers make the second-largest contribution to total landings (18.1 percent) and have a greater
                                    relative importance (23.5 percent) in the Mediterranean (where the western Mediterranean
                                    shows the highest peak, at 26.1 percent) than in the Black Sea (7.9 percent). Small-scale
                                    vessels are better represented in Mediterranean landings (19.9 percent of the total, reaching
                                    33.9 percent in the central Mediterranean) than in the Black Sea (4.9 percent). Finally, the
                                    miscellaneous group “other fleet segments” accounts for 8.3 percent of the total landings,
                                    with a slightly higher share of landings in the Mediterranean (8.9 percent in total, peaking
                                    in the Adriatic Sea at 14.1 percent) than in the Black Sea (7.1 percent).
                                    2.3 Landings and species
                                    Landings in the GFCM area of application are largely dominated by small pelagic
                                    fish, mainly European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus, 343 000 tonnes) and sardine
                                    (also known as European pilchard, Sardina pilchardus) 141 400 tonnes). European
                                    anchovy and sardine are predominant in the Adriatic Sea (contributing 20.1 percent and
                                    47.4 percent of total landings, respectively), the western Mediterranean (13 percent and
                                    17.8 percent, respectively) and the eastern Mediterranean (14.2 percent and 14.4 percent,
                                    respectively). Sardinella (Sardinella spp.) is important in the western (15.6 percent) and
                                    the eastern Mediterranean (5 percent), whereas in the Black Sea European anchovy
                                    (65 percent) and European sprat (Sprattus sprattus, 13 percent) dominate in terms of
                                    landings (FIGURE D.5.3).
                                       Several demersal species have followed an overall increasing trend in landings: deep‑wa-
                                    ter rose shrimp (Parapenaeus longirostris), common cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis), red mullet
                                    (Mullus barbatus) and surmullet (Mullus surmuletus), and rapa whelk (Rapana venosa)
                                    in the Black Sea (FAO, 2023). In contrast, the landings of several other demersal species
                                    have decreased in recent years, including European hake (Merluccius merluccius) across
                                    the Mediterranean and whiting (Merlangius merlangus) in the Black Sea.
                                       The overall diversity of species, represented by the lowest number of species that can
                                    be summed together to account for 90 percent of the total catch, is much lower in the
                                    Black Sea (five species) than in the Mediterranean Sea (55 species, ranging from 15 in the

2.4 Fisheries management
The specific characteristics described in previous sections, together with the large number
of stocks, make Mediterranean and Black Sea fisheries challenging to assess and manage,
requiring good data and scientific capacity, coupled with strong regional cooperation, to
effectively identify and implement combinations of different types of measures at regional
level, in a move towards adaptive management.
   Within the GFCM, stock assessments are performed and evaluated through the
Scientific Advisory Committee for Fisheries (SAC) and its Working Groups for Stock
Assessment (WGSAs) in the Mediterranean, and the Working Group on the Black Sea
(WGBS) and its Subregional Group on Assessment for the Black Sea (SGSABS) in the
Black Sea. The number of non-deprecated validated assessments (i.e. assessments from
previous years that are still considered to be valid) has increased progressively in recent
years, reaching a total of 114 in the reference year 2021, covering 28 out of the 30 GSAs
in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. This reflects a continued improvement in the
spatial and temporal coverage of the stocks for which scientific advice is provided, which
goes hand-in-hand with the increased quantity and quality of input data.
   The 42nd session of the GFCM in 2019 (FAO, 2019) endorsed an externally-reviewed
process for benchmarking stock assessments, providing a framework to ensure the quality
of the advice produced while also building capacity.

   Concurrently, the regulation of fisheries in Area 37 has advanced, with the introduc-
tion and adoption of multiannual management plans. Within this approach, and without
prejudice to addressing additional species, the GFCM has agreed on a list, by subregion,
of priority commercial species for which advice should be produced (TABLE D.5.1). Priority
species have been agreed in consultation with experts and managers, based on a combination
of information, socioeconomic importance and conservation concerns; stock assessments
are prioritized accordingly.
   Since the adoption of the first comprehensive GFCM multiannual management
plan – for small pelagic fisheries in the Adriatic Sea in 2013 – the GFCM has adopted a
total of 11 adaptive multiannual management plans. Today, most GFCM multiannual
management plans are implemented in different phases, foreseeing an initial period
(usually three years) for implementing transitional measures while advancing on scien-
tific work whose outcomes will comprise the basis for a second phase (usually five years)
that implements long-term adaptive measures. The GFCM has established a process
to inform management plans, including a compilation of all background information
and the creation of technical elements for management, that, if successful, results in the
management plan being adopted as a binding recommendation at the GFCM annual
session. Multiannual management plans include combinations of management meas-
ures tailored to each fishery. These measures include classical input (effort limits) and/or
output (catch limits and TACs) controls coupled with technical measures (e.g. minimum
conservation reference sizes, mesh size, gear modifications, selectivity devices etc.) and
spatial management to protect vulnerable marine ecosystems and essential fish habitats.
Currently about 58 percent of the Mediterranean is protected from bottom trawling
through 11 different Fisheries Restricted Areas (FRAs), including below 1 000 m.
   Adaptive mechanisms to achieve and maintain objectives within a desired time frame
are also specified, thus ensuring adaptability to changing and evolving stocks, fisheries and
environments. At the basis of this adaptive framework are both forecasts and performance
testing using management strategy evaluation. This process has recently taken an important
step forward by facilitating the estimation of single species quotas for European anchovy and
sardine in the Adriatic Sea, based on species-specific harvest control rules. The management
strategy evaluation process is opening the door to management plans that are ever more
focused on gathering information to assess and achieve social and economic sustainability
in addition to biological sustainability, as well as involving stakeholders.

3. RESOURCE STATUS
The status of fish stocks in Area 37 for stock assessments that are formally reviewed and
validated by the GFCM is summarized and published biennially in SoMFi, with the
most recent report in 2023 based on the reference year 2021 (FAO, 2023). Stock status
evaluations for SoMFi are currently based on fishing pressure with respect to FMSY (fishing
pressure that gives the maximum sustainable yield [MSY] or its proxy in the long term)
at a stock level to classify stocks as “in overexploitation” or “in sustainable exploitation”.
   In this report, this approach to assessing sustainability of stocks was translated into
FAO classification as explained below.
3.1 Reference list of stocks
The reference list of stocks for Area 37 in this report was revised based on the new method-
ology (PART B, METHODOLOGY, pp. 6). Since 2019, all stock assessment outcomes, validated
by the GFCM, are stored in the Stock Assessment Results (STAR) database, which forms
the basis of the SoMFi report (FAO, 2023). According to the updated methodology of
this report, the STAR database provided the status of 89.5 percent of stocks (102 stocks)
in the revised reference list for Area 37. The inclusion of assessments in this list was kept
consistent with the SoMFi rules for non-deprecated assessments (small pelagic species:
assessments no older than three years; demersal species: assessments no older than five
years). These 102 stocks were complemented by 12 additional unique stocks derived from
SDG 14.4.1 questionnaires submitted to FAO by national agencies. The SDG database

Mediterranean and Black Sea



                                    was systematically scanned to identify additional stocks with stock status estimates that
                                    were not covered by the GFCM STAR database, according to the following rules:

                                    1. Subset reference year using the SoMFi rule for non-deprecated assessments.
                                    2. Subset “workshop tier” and review to stocks that were assigned Tier 1 or 3 (initially)
                                       by excluding stocks with “old data” or “insufficient data”.
                                    3. Remove stocks that were not in Area 37.
                                    4. Remove all stocks readily covered by the SoMFi 2023 stock reference list.
                                    5. Following a review of Tier 3 stock, only one stock in the Sea of Azov (Azov round
                                       goby) remained, but it had no reference points (empirical methods)
                                       and was removed.
                                       This resulted in a total of 114 monitored stocks (TABLE D.5.2), comprising 39 species,
                                    being included in the updated reference stock list for Area 37 (APPENDIX II, TABLE 5, pp.
                                    427). This represents an additional 74 stocks compared to the previous methodology
                                    which used 40 aggregated stocks. The percentage of the total capture fisheries produc-
                                    tion in Area 37 for the species monitored covered by at least one assessment remains very
                                    similar to the previous methodology, at 74.1 percent.

                                    3.2 Classification of the status of stocks
                                    3.2.1 METHODOLOGY
                                    GFCM stock status classification and terminology was mapped and “translated” to match
                                    FAO terminology (PART B, METHODOLOGY, pp. 6) and to ensure full comparability with
                                    results emerging from other FAO Major Fishing Areas. The updated FAO methodology
                                    classifies stocks into tiers based on the availability and quality of information for each stock
                                    (Tier 1, Tier 2 or Tier 3). In general, stock status classification is straightforward in cases
                                    where estimates of the biomass level that can produce MSY in the long term (BMSY)or a direct
                                    proxy are available. However, within Area 37, stock status classification is typically based on
                                    fishing mortality relative to proxies for FMSY (e.g. F0.1), which define target fishing mortality
                                    Ftgt, and there are difficulties in estimating biomass reference points from the relatively short
                                    time series. Although the number of stocks for which biomass reference points are estimated
                                    is increasing every year, estimates of the target biomass reference point BMSY (which defines
                                    Btgt) were only available for about 40 percent of the validated quantitative assessments
                                    (n = 80). An additional 6.4 percent of stock assessments provided limit biomass reference
                                    points (Bpa and Blim), but without an estimate for target reference point BMSY.
                                        The stock status classification for validated qualitative assessments is often corrob-
                                    orated by multiple analytical assessment methods and therefore provides a descriptive
PART D.5 ■ Regional overview ■ Area 37: Mediterranean and Black Sea                              139



stock classifier, such as “Possibly in overexploitation” or “Possibly sustainably exploited”,
instead of distinct values for F/FMSY or B/BMSY.
   To accommodate a consistent stock classification for FAO, the following classification
rules were applied.
   If a direct proxy for BMSY is available:
 O: B/Btgt < 0.8
 M: 0.8 ≤ B/Btgt ≤ 1.2
 U: B/Btgt > 1.2 (Note all cases have F < Ftgt)
   If the precautionary biomass reference points Bpa exists but not BMSY
 O: B < 2Bpa0.8
 M: B ≥ 2Bpa0.8
  This is considering that Bpa was typically set to 0.5BMSY in recent benchmark assess-
ments, whereas 0.8 is the lower FAO bound. Therefore, the following approximation
applies: 0.8 BMSY = 2Bpa0.8. Note that only one stock has Bpa > 1 in the absence of BMSY. In
this case B/Bpa > 3 and F/FMSY < 1, so there is no ambiguity when classifying this stock as M.
  If no biomass reference point exists, but the ratio F/FMSY is available:
 O: F/Ftgt > 1
 M: F/Ftgt ≤ 1
 In the absence of a biomass reference point, the F-based classification becomes
   binary (O/M): it does not employ the 0.8–1.2 buffer and does not classify any
   stocks as underfished (U). The reason for not classifying as U is that it is not clear
   if a stock with F/Ftgt << 1 (e.g. F/FMSY < 0.5) is under rebuilding (B < 0.8BMSY) or
   underfished (U). The binary classification for a threshold of F/Ftgt = 1 is selected to
   achieve overall classification with the GFCM status advice.
   For qualitative assessments, with only a descriptive stock status classifier, stocks were
classified either:
 O: “Possibly in overexploitation”, “Possibly overexploited” or “Possibly depleted”
 M: “Possibly sustainable” or “Possibly sustainably exploited”
   It should be noted that the stock status classification rules employed for Area 37 stocks
are very conservative.
3.2.2 STOCK STATUS AND CLASSIFICATION BY TIERS
All the 114 stocks in Area 37 are classified as Tier 1 stocks, which means they are assessed
using “traditional” stock assessments and are deemed reliable. The main separation in
terms of assessment quality is assigned by the level of uncertainty. All validated quan-
titative assessments were assigned a “low” uncertainty (79 stocks), whereas qualitative
validated assessments and supplementary stocks were assigned a “medium” uncertainty
level (35 stocks). Qualitative assessments are conducted with “traditional” stock assess-
ment methods, but, through the review process, status classification is deemed to be based
on data associated with higher uncertainty, so that improvement of data and refinements
of the assessment may be needed prior to providing full quantitative advice. Overall for
Area 37, of the 114 assessed stocks, 7.9 percent are considered underfished, 27.2 percent
are considered maximally sustainably fished, and 64.9 percent are overfished (TABLE D.5.3).
When weighted by their production levels, biologically sustainable stocks account for
56.9 percent of the 2021 landings of assessed stocks monitored by FAO (TABLE D.5.4A).

Mediterranean and Black Sea



                                    4. SELECTED IMPORTANT KEY SPECIES
                                    4.1 Small pelagic fishes
                                    4.1.1 EUROPEAN ANCHOVY AND SARDINE
                                    European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus) is a priority species in all subregions of the
                                    Mediterranean and the Black Sea. The anchovy stock in the Black Sea produced on average
                                    more than 250 000 tonnes over the period 2020–2021, representing 65 percent of all
                                    reported landings in the Black Sea and the largest landing volume produced by a single
                                    stock unit in Area 37. Anchovy in the Black Sea represents four of the nine anchovy stock
                                    units that are currently classified as maximally sustainably fished, whereas three stocks
                                    are considered overfished and two underfished.
                                       Sardine (also known as European pilchard, Sardina pilchardus) is a priority in all subre-
                                    gions of the Mediterranean Sea. Sardine is targeted by the same fleets as European anchovy
                                    and generally appears more vulnerable to fishing pressure with six of the 12 assessed stocks
                                    classified as overfished.
                                       Both European anchovy and sardine are under a multiannual management plan in the
                                    Adriatic Sea (GSAs 17, 18), where they represent the two predominant species, contribut-
                                    ing 20.1 percent and 47.4 percent of total Adriatic Sea landings, respectively. Following
                                    the recent conclusion of a comprehensive management strategy evaluation process, the
                                    47th annual session of the GFCM determined the long-term portion of the management
                                    plan, setting species-specific quotas, based on the best-performing harvest control rules,
                                    for the first time in the Mediterranean Sea.
                                    4.1.2 ROUND SARDINELLA
                                    In the eastern Mediterranean, round sardinella (Sardinella aurita) is also included in the
                                    list of priority species, commonly reported as sardinellas NEI (Sardinella spp.). It is the
                                    predominant species after European sardine and anchovy in terms of landings, contribut-
                                    ing more than 5 percent of total landings in the subregion. The currently overfished status
                                    of round sardinella is monitored by assessments of the two stocks in the northeast Levant
                                    Sea (GSA 24, 27N) and in the southeast Levant Sea (GSA 25, 27S). These two assessments
                                    were the first to be successfully benchmarked in the eastern Mediterranean subregion.
                                    4.1.3 EUROPEAN SPRAT
                                    European sprat (Sprattus sprattus) is the second most important species in terms of land-
                                    ings in the Black Sea, representing 13 percent of landings; it is also included in the list of
                                    priority species. It is monitored by a recently finalized benchmark assessment and classified
                                    as maximally sustainably fished. The GFCM recommendation setting measures for the
                                    management of European sprat in the Black Sea is the first GFCM decision formally
                                    requiring an analysis of the possible climatic effects and their incorporation within the
                                    advice on stock status and potential management measures for European sprat.

                                    4.2 Demersal fishes
                                    4.2.1 EUROPEAN HAKE
                                    European hake (Merluccius merluccius) is the dominant gadoid species in commercial
                                    catches across the Mediterranean Sea, where it is a priority species in all regions and
                                    among the most widely assessed species. Although European hake has shown an overall
                                    decreasing trend in both landings and fishing pressure since 2013, all ten stocks monitored
                                    by validated assessments remain in an overfished state. Three stocks are monitored by
                                    annual updates of benchmark assessments, of which the central Mediterranean stock in
                                    the Strait of Sicily (GSAs 12–16) and the Adriatic Sea stock (GSAs 17, 18) showed the
                                    strongest signals of an onsetting recovery and a good response to existing multiannual
                                    management plans. The biomass levels of the stock in the Strait of Sicily are approaching
                                    the sustainability threshold of 80 percent of BMSY. European hake is exposed to high
                                    fishing mortality on juveniles by commercial otter trawling, while only passive gears, such
                                    as longlines and gillnets, catch a meaningful fraction of large mature females. Similarly,
PART D.5 ■ Regional overview ■ Area 37: Mediterranean and Black Sea                            143




demersal surveys select against large individuals and, therefore, mostly represent changes
in juvenile abundance. This also poses challenges to assessments of European hake, with
spawning biomass often remaining difficult to estimate. Progress has been made by explic-
itly integrating data from passive fleets into integrated multi-fleet assessment models for
the Adriatic Sea (GSAs 17,18) and the Strait of Sicily (12–16), which enabled improved
inference about the available spawning biomass and thus stock status.
4.2.2 RED MULLET
Red mullet (Mullus barbatus) is a priority species throughout the Mediterranean and
the Black Sea. It is caught in large volumes over muddy bottoms (50–200 m) by bottom
trawlers and represents the predominant commercial species within the group of miscel-
laneous coastal fishes (ASFIS 33). Stock structuring of red mullet is complex, which is also
reflected by the large number of assessments of individual stock units (16 stocks). Fishing
pressure on red mullet has shown an overall decreasing trend since 2013. In contrast to
the last detailed Review of the state of world marine fishery resources (FAO, 2011), which
found that 100 percent of ten assessed stocks were overfished, in this report, 31 percent
and 13 percent are respectively classified as maximally sustainably fished and underfished,
whereas 56 percent remain in an overfished state. An example of a successful rebuilding
of red mullet is the Adriatic Sea stock, where major reductions of demersal fishing effort,
together with spatial and temporal inshore trawling restrictions and mesh size regulation
measures under the multiannual management plan for key demersal species of the Adriatic
Sea, have contributed to strong increases in biomass to levels above BMSY.
4.2.3 FLATFISHES
The important fisheries for common sole (Solea solea) in the northern Adriatic Sea (GSA 17)
and turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) in the Black Sea (GSA 29) target the two priority
flatfish species, which are both managed under multiannual management plans.
   Common sole is an important commercial species in the central and northern Adriatic
Sea, representing more than USD 20 million in terms of landing value. More than half the
landings are made by a target fishery with beam trawlers, while the remaining catch is simi-
larly split between gill- and trammel netters and otter trawlers. Monitored by an annually
updated benchmark assessment since 2019, Adriatic common sole has been rebuilt from
an overfished (F > FMSY) to a maximally sustainably fished stock, which was associated with
a continuous reduction of fishing effort by more than 70 percent since 2013.
   The turbot stock in the Black Sea is shared among all riparian countries. The stock
has been under a multiannual management plan since 2017 and has been monitored by
annual updates of a benchmarked assessment since 2019. The main fishing gear for turbot
is gillnets, but in Türkiye bottom trawling is also permitted. Although turbot currently
remains in an overfished state with respect to BMSY, there are strong signals of rebuilding,
evidenced by a threefold increase in biomass since 2017 that was associated with a threefold
decrease in fishing mortality to levels below FMSY. However, quantifying and determining
significant landings from IUU fishing remains the biggest challenge towards sustainable
exploitation of this stock.

4.3 Crustaceans
4.3.1 DEEP-WATER RED SHRIMPS
Deep-water red shrimps are the main target of Mediterranean bottom trawl fisheries in
depths of 400–1 000 m. They comprise two species: blue and red shrimp (Aristeus anten-
natus) and giant red shrimp (Aristaeomorpha foliacea). These are often mixed in catches,
in varying proportions according to the geographic area. As highly valuable commercial
species with relatively slow growth rates, deep-water red shrimps have been subjected
to some of the highest exploitation rates in the region (FAO, 2023). All three stocks of
giant red shrimp covered by quantitative assessments were found to be overfished, while
out of the six stocks of blue and red shrimp assessed, only one was found to be maximally
sustainably fished (northern Alboran Sea), while the rest was classified as overfished. It

Mediterranean and Black Sea



                                    is worth noting that, despite a significant expansion of fishing activities in the eastern
                                    Mediterranean in recent decades (Fiorentino et al., 2024) as well as ongoing efforts
                                    to improve fishery-dependent and fishery-independent data, to date qualitative stock
                                    assessments are not available for this subregion. Deep-water red shrimps are GFCM
                                    priority species in the central and eastern Mediterranean, where, since 2023, they have
                                    been covered by three multiannual management plans in the Strait of Sicily and the
                                    Ionian and Levant Seas. These plans mandate, inter alia, species-specific catch limits and
                                    spatiotemporal measures with the objective of achieving exploitation levels consistent
                                    with MSY by 2030 at the latest.
                                       Deep-water rose shrimp (Parapenaeus longirostris) is an important resource in the
                                    Mediterranean Sea, where it produces the largest landings of a crustacean (FAO, 2023)
                                    and ranks as fourth in terms of total economic value among the main commercial species
                                    in the Mediterranean subregions (FAO, 2022). Deep-water rose shrimp has followed an
                                    overall increasing trend in landings from 7 000 tonnes in 1970 to 22 700 tonnes in 2021,
                                    with landings peaking in 2018 at 25 900 tonnes. The species typically occurs in shallower
                                    waters than deep-water red shrimps, and is almost exclusively targeted by bottom trawlers
                                    along the continental shelf at depths of 100–400 m (Knittweis et al., 2013). Deep-water
                                    rose shrimp is short-lived, reproduces throughout the year and is characterized by high
                                    growth and mortality rates. The species exhibits a thermophilic preference for warmer
                                    waters (Colloca et al., 2014), and its biomass dynamics seem to be largely driven by envi-
                                    ronmental regimes. Of the nine stocks monitored in the reference year 2021, seven were
                                    classified as overfished and only two as maximally sustainably fished. It is a priority species
                                    in the central Mediterranean and Adriatic Sea, where it is under multiannual manage-
                                    ment plans, and the two relevant stocks (GSAs 12–16 and GSAs 17–20) are monitored
                                    by annually updated benchmark assessments.
                                       In general, the large environmentally driven population fluctuations pose a major
                                    challenge for stock status classification of this species, and specifically for determining
                                    appropriate biomass reference point levels. Catches tend to increase simultaneously with
                                    biomass during high productivity regimes, which can result in stocks being classified as
                                    overfished in the absence of a BMSY reference point (i.e. F > FMSY), even if the stock is at
                                    very high biomass levels. However, the recent benchmark assessment of the stock in the
                                    Adriatic and western Ionian Sea (GSAs 17–20) prompted significant advances in the
                                    assessment methodology for this species by applying stochastic biomass dynamic models
                                    that can account for time-varying productivity regimes and estimate biomass relative
                                    BMSY. Current efforts to explore this approach for other stocks may provide improved
                                    inference about the state of the deep-water rose shrimp resource and a stepping stone
                                    towards a more adaptive management advice.
                                    4.3.3 NORWAY LOBSTER
                                    Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) is mostly exploited by bottom trawls and, to a lesser
                                    extent, by baited traps. These gears sample different portions of the population: trawls
                                    will only catch individuals when they happen to be outside of their burrows, while the
                                    bait in traps entices animals out of their burrows. Average values of F/FMSY for Norway
                                    lobster in the Mediterranean Sea are approaching sustainable exploitation (FAO, 2023).
                                    The species is a priority species in the Adriatic Sea (GSAs 17, 18), where it burrows within
                                    muddy grounds at depths from around 50 m to more than 400 m, and is the most valuable
                                    crustacean species landed in the subregion. Norway lobster is the only species covered by
                                    the Adriatic Sea multiannual demersal management plan whose assessment still has to be
                                    consolidated: different assessments tracking different combinations of GSAs all indicate
                                    the species is overfished in the subregion. A benchmarking process is currently underway.

                                    When applied to Area 37, the updated methodology results in a much longer reference

                                    stocks that were aggregated at the level of 27 species groups used to determine an overall

   Despite the increased number of stocks and changes in methodology, the overall
percentage of overfished stocks (64.9 percent) has remained similar to the 62.5 percent
of overfished stocks reported with the previous methodology in 2021 (TABLE D.5.5). What
differs is the percentages of underfished stocks, which are considerably higher with the
updated methodology. In addition, the coverage of 74.1 percent of landings has remained
relatively stable in comparison with 74.3 percent of landings assessed with the previ-
ous methodology in 2021 (TABLE D.5.6). When weighted by landings, the percentage of
sustainable stocks increased under the updated and previous methodlogy to 56.9 percent
and 45.5 percent, respectively. A notable difference is that some species with relatively
high catch volumes, such as the Striped venus (Chamelea gallina) with 36 700 tonnes
and Black Sea sprat (Clupeonella cultriventris) with 7 600 tonnes, were captured in the
list of assessed species with the previous methodology (FAO, 2024), but are absent from
the new reference list of stocks because they are not assessed.
   A comparison with the last detailed Review of the state of world marine fishery resources
(FAO, 2011) indicates some notable changes. The number of stock assessments has more

                                    than doubled, increasing from 40 in 2011 to 114 in 2021, while the percentage of over-
                                    fished stocks reduced from 78 percent in 2011 to 65 percent in 2021.
                                       When considering the finer details of assessments used in this report, it is clear that
                                    significant improvements have been made. The past decade marked a significant increase
                                    in the number of stocks assessed in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, together with
                                    a substantial improvement in the data collected at the national level and the capacity of
                                    national experts to perform assessments, supported by capacity development activities and
                                    the benchmarking process. In the past, the status of Mediterranean stocks was tracked
                                    primarily based on fishing mortality indicators, whereas the improvements in the quantity
                                    and quality of assessments have more recently enabled stock status estimates for a stead-
                                    ily increasing number of stocks in terms of biomass at sea. This will ensure that future
                                    analyses of Mediterranean-specific stock status will be more closely aligned with those
                                    performed in other FAO Major Fishing Areas, including estimating BMSY.
                                       Since 2013, 11 multiannual management plans have been adopted with the objective
                                    of achieving sustainable exploitation of several priority species in different areas of the
                                    Mediterranean and the Black Sea. Multiannual management plans include or are comple-
                                    mented by 11 FRAs. The GFCM’s continued focus on expanding adaptive multiannual
                                    management plans and adopting combinations of input/output measures (e.g. effort/
                                    catch limits) along with technical and spatial measures is having positive results for key
                                    commercial species. This is demonstrated by a continuous reduction in fishing pressure
                                    (F/FMSY) throughout the region, which has fallen by 31 percent since 2013, while rela-
                                    tive biomass (B/BMSY) has increased by more than 15 percent over the same period (FAO,
                                    2023; FIGURE D.5.5).
                                       The status of several stocks managed through management plans has shown impor-
                                    tant signs of improvement. For example, several of the of European hake (Merluccius
                                    merluccius) stocks covered by dedicated management plans showed notable reduction in
                                    overfishing, some of them already revealing signs of biomass rebuilding. Another nota-
                                    ble example includes a 77 percent reduction in fishing pressure for common sole (Solea
                                    solea) in the Adriatic Sea, which has now reached sustainable exploitation rates and has
                                    allowed the effort reductions for Adriatic beam trawls to be halted. The improvement
                                    in several demersal stocks in several Mediterranean subregions and the Black Sea (e.g.
                                    red mullets and Black Sea turbot) is likely due to the combination of an effort regime
                                    and/or catch limits for the bottom trawl fleet, with appropriate spatial management (e.g.
                                    GFCM fisheries restricted areas) and technical measures (e.g. enhanced selectivity), aided
                                    by appropriate monitoring, control and surveillance actions (e.g. the joint international
                                    inspection schemes). A positive example is provided by the demersal resources in the
                                    Adriatic Sea, which are benefiting from the combined effects of an effort regime, spatio-
                                    temporal measures and a FRA in the Jabuka/Pomo Pit.1 In addition, the finalization of
                                    a rigorous management strategy evaluation process in the Adriatic Sea supported a land-
                                    mark decision to establish single species harvest control rules and annual catch limits for
                                    sardine (also known as European pilchard, Sardina pilchardus) and European anchovy
                                    (Engraulis encrasicolus), moving away from the joint catch limits enforced until now and
                                    promoting ecological sustainability and economic stability.

 KEY MESSAGES

  Small-scale fishing boats comprise ~4/5 of the fleet, but larger vessels,
   such as purse seiners and trawlers, account for 77 percent of the landings.
  There are 11 multiannual management plans and 11 related Fishery
   Restricted Areas in Area 37. These have positive results for key
   commercial species, shown by a continuous reduction in fishing pressure
   and relative biomass increase.
  Management measures are used extensively in Area 37 to protect
   vulnerable marine ecosystems, bycatch species and essential fish
   habitats.

1. OVERVIEW
The Southwest Atlantic, designated by FAO as Major Fishing Area 41 (hereafter, Area 41),
covers a total surface of 17.65 million km2 off the eastern coast of South America, between
latitudes 05° north off northern Brazil and 60° south off southern Argentina and the
Falkland Islands (Malvinas) (FIGURE D.6.1).
It is one of the world’s most productive
marine regions, characterized by rich               FIGURE D.6.1

of people. This productivity has made it
a focal point for intense fishing pressure
from both national and international
fleets. The high demand for commer-
cially valuable species has resulted in
heavy fishing activity, posing significant
challenges to the sustainability of fish
populations and the overall health of
marine ecosystems.                                                                                      41.1
   Area 41 has distinct environmental
characteristics which influence fisher-
ies in the region. In the northern part of
Area 41, the continental shelf extends up
to 160 nautical miles (nm) and is influ-
enced by deposits from the Amazon
River. The narrow, coral-rich shelf is not                                                              41.2

                           and shifts in species distributions (Hobday and Pecl, 2014; Gianelli et al., 2019; Gianelli et
                           al., 2021). Although the region supports valuable fisheries, it also poses governance chal-
                           lenges due to overlapping jurisdictions and complex oceanographic conditions (Defeo et
                           al., 2025). The southernmost region of Area 41 (41° south to 60° south) features dynamic
                           conditions shaped by the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence, where the nutrient-rich Malvinas
                           Current meets the warm Brazil Current, fostering high productivity and diverse ecosys-
                           tems (Acha et al., 2024; Piola et al., 2024). The Patagonian Shelf, one of the world’s largest
                           continental shelves, enhances nutrient cycling and habitat diversity. Variability driven
                           by the Southern Annular Mode affects productivity and species distribution, sustaining
                           significant fisheries and biodiversity (Acha et al., 2004, 2024; Alemany et al., 2024).
                              Analysis of Area 41 landings from 1950 to 2019 reveals an initial growth phase, peak-
                           ing in 1997, followed by a decline and stabilization of catches at approximately 2 million
                           tonnes annually. It also reveals a shift in fisheries dynamics, with historical catches being
                           dominated by two key species – Argentine hake (Merluccius hubbsi) and Argentine short-
                           fin squid (Illex argentinus) – which represented 40 percent of historical catches, reflecting
                           the region’s past industrial fisheries’ reliance on a few dominant resources. The current
                           shift in fisheries dynamics is exemplified by transformations like the Argentine anchovy
                           (Engraulis anchoita) fishery, which evolved from small-scale operations to multi-fleet
                           systems. Similarly, the “variado costero” fishery in Buenos Aires targets multi-species
                           demersal assemblages using diverse fishing methods. These developments necessitate
                           comprehensive stock assessments that account for the complexities of multi-fleet and
                           multi-gear fisheries. The growing diversity in catch composition, especially since the
                           1980s, highlights the need to expand FAO reference lists and methodologies to include
                           emerging fisheries targeting species of high economic value.

                           2. FISHERY PROFILES
                           The Southwest Atlantic Ocean is of vital importance to global fisheries, providing essential
                           resources that sustain the livelihoods of millions of people. The best and most extensive
                           trawling areas are located in the Río de la Plata region, the Patagonian Shelf, and the
                           Falkland Islands (Malvinas), where the shelf extends far beyond the 200 nm limit from
                           the coastline, forming the largest and most productive continental shelf in the Southern
                           Hemisphere (Bertrand et al., 2018; Franco et al., 2020). This productivity makes it a
                           focal point for intense fishing pressure from national and international fleets (Defeo et
                           al., 2025).
                              The fisheries sector in Area 41 supports a diverse range of activities, involving 32 000
                           active vessels, including both artisanal and industrial operations, and 896 000 people
                           engaged in the primary sector. Long-term average reported catches amount to around
                           2 million tonnes per year, generating an annual economic value exceeding USD 5.5 billion
                           (FAO, 2024). The high demand for commercially valuable species has led to intense fish-
                           ing activity, posing significant challenges to the sustainability of fish populations and the
                           health of marine ecosystems (Defeo and Vasconcellos, 2020; FAO, 2024).
                              The fisheries in Area 41 have undergone significant changes over time, as is evidenced
                           by long-term catch trends. From 1950 to 1997 landings increased steadily, driven by the
                           expansion of fishing activities. However, a subsequent decline followed until 2004, after
                           which annual landings stabilized at approximately 2 million tonnes, although showing
                           high inter-annual variability (FIGURE D.6.2). Two species dominate the catches in this
                           region: the Argentine hake (Merluccius hubbsi) and the Argentine shortfin squid (Illex
                           argentinus), which together have accounted for about 40 percent of total landings since
                           1950.

   A marked shift in the fisheries landscape occurred during the 1980s and 1990s, driven
by declining yields of some traditionally exploited demersal species. This decline prompted
the emergence of fisheries targeting underexploited stocks with high economic value,
fueled by increasing international demand (Gianelli and Defeo, 2017).
   Key fisheries in the region have undergone significant evolution. For instance, the
Argentine anchovy (Engraulis anchoita) fishery shifted from small-scale operations
using traditional “Rada” or “Ría” vessels to a more complex multi-fleet system by 2018,
including high-seas, coastal, and artisanal vessels. Similarly, the “variado costero” fish-
ery in Buenos Aires demonstrates the increasing prevalence of multi-species fisheries.
This fishery targets an assemblage of approximately 30 demersal species using various
methods, including bottom and midwater trawling, longlines, gillnets and traps. These
developments highlight the intricate dynamics of modern fisheries, requiring adaptive
management strategies.
   The small-scale fisheries sub-sector has been somewhat overlooked in the region despite
its vital importance. Generally, these fisheries are considered data-poor, which poses
challenges for comprehensive assessment and management (Basurto et al., 2025). For
example, in Brazil, small-scale fisheries contribute more than 90 percent of the employ-
ment in the fisheries sector. As of 2011, nearly 600 000 fishers were directly engaged in
full-time fishing activities, primarily operating fleets of vessels less than 12 m in length.
While the industrial fishing fleet is concentrated in southern Brazil, the majority of
small-scale fishery activities take place in northern and northeastern regions. Landings
from these fisheries include approximately 200 fish species, 20 crustacean species, and
14 mollusc species (Bertrand et al., 2018; FAO, Duke and Worldfish, unpublished data).
Marine extractive reserves represent the most significant government-supported initiative
aimed at protecting the common-property resources upon which traditional small-scale
fishers depend. These reserves benefit approximately 60 000 small-scale fishers along the
coast. However, their effectiveness as a conservation tool is hindered by weak enforce-
ment and various anthropogenic and economic pressures, such as tourism (Santos and
Schiavetti, 2014).
   The transboundary nature of the primary stocks exploited in Area 41 poses substantial
challenges for fisheries management, as it requires alignment with the life cycle charac-
teristics of these stocks and demands multinational collaboration. Nevertheless, stock
assessments and management practices often remain restricted by geopolitical boundaries,
disregarding the ecological realities of stock distributions and fishing activities (Defeo et
al., 2025). Additionally, the diversification of fisheries has emerged as a hallmark of the
region, driven by shifts in socioeconomic and ecological dynamics. Compounding these
challenges, the region is experiencing significant oceanographic changes that are altering
the distribution and abundance of key stocks across their entire geographic range.

3. RESOURCE STATUS

3.1 Reference list of stocks
The fish stocks that FAO has monitored since 1974 in Area 41 draw from a wide spec-
trum of data, ranging from data-rich and formally assessed stocks, to those that have
very little information apart from catch statistics, and those with no stock assessment
at all. In consultation with most of the countries of Area 41, an updated reference list of
stocks was compiled and classified, based on landings and/or socioeconomic importance
(APPENDIX II, TABLE 6 , pp. 429). All the information compiled was used to update the anal-
ysis on the state of the fisheries in Area 41. When possible, the list of reference stocks was
matched with the list used by FAO in past assessments of the state of fisheries resources,

                           and inconsistencies in the species names were corrected. In this report, the reference list
                           of stocks for Area 41 covers 53 species or species groups and 69 stock units (TABLE D.6.1).

                           Overall, landings of assessed stocks in Area 41 amounted to over 1.68 million tonnes

                           3.2 Classification of the status of stocks
                           Results indicate that 42.0 percent of stocks in Area 41 are overfished, 43.5 percent are
                           maximally sustainably fished, and 14.5 percent are underfished (TABLE D.6.2). These
                           findings align closely with previous assessments but provide enhanced resolution and
                           were generated based on greater local participation, fostering regional collaboration.
                           When weighted by landings volumes, an estimated 68.4 percent of the 2021 landings
                           were from sustainable stocks.
                              Tier 1 stocks (with formal assessments) represent about 76.8 percent of Area 41 land-
                           ings, covering 46 assessment units and 34 operational taxonomic units (most of them
                           at the species resolution level) (TABLE D.6.1), of which several species are also distributed
                           in international waters and exploited by foreign fleets. The remaining species and stocks
                           (units of assessment) are under the exclusive jurisdiction of the countries of the Area or in
                           shared waters (e.g. the Argentinian-Uruguayan Common Fishing Zone, AUCFZ). Most
                           Tier 1 stocks are managed by Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay. These results include those
                           stocks traditionally assessed by FAO and also stocks/units of assessment identified during
                           the consultation process. In some instances, landings were aggregated under broader
                           taxonomic categories (e.g. at the family level), while in others, taxonomic information
                           needed to be updated. The stocks in the reference list correspond as much as possible to
                           actual management or operational units, thus enhancing the linkages between the FAO
                           Index and the assessment and management initiatives at the national or regional levels.
                              A total of 23 Tier 2 stocks were identified during the consultation process (TABLE D.6.1).
                           Most of the Tier 2 stocks identified have associated effort and catch per unit effort
                           (CPUE) estimates. For species, stocks or units of assessment where effort or CPUE data
                           is available, extra effort should be made to select the most reliable estimates, with an
                           emphasis on long-term data series. Additionally, it was important to prioritize the most
                           significant fisheries/gear combinations for stocks that span multiple jurisdictions. Tier
                           2 species and the corresponding stocks or assessment units were included in this docu-

FAO reference list; and (3) other stocks of relevance for Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay
that are mainly managed under their specific jurisdictions. The SRAplus package (Ovando

model. Models employed effort estimates extracted from Rousseau et al. (2019) or specific
inputs of fishing effort or abundance indices derived from, for instance, research surveys
by the respective jurisdictions.

4. KEY SELECTED SPECIES AND GROUPS
This section identifies and discusses species and stocks that are currently most important
for Area 41 (FIGURE D.6.2).
4.1 Argentine hake
The Argentine hake (Merluccius hubbsi) is a benthopelagic species inhabiting the shelf
and upper continental slope of the Southwest Atlantic Ocean, from 25° south (Cabo
Frio, Brazil) to 48° south (Argentinian shelf). The number of stocks has been subject to
scientific debate. Four main stocks have been identified for assessment and management
purposes in the South Atlantic Ocean (Bezzi et al., 1994; Vaz-dos-Santos and Schwingel,
2015); these stocks are located in (1) Southeastern Brazil, 21° to 29° south, (2) waters
across Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina, from 29° to 41° south, (3) Southern Argentina
41                   156                                                                                                    Review of the state of world marine fishery resources




                                    (Patagonian stock), mainly 41° to 48° south, and (4) the San Matías Gulf (41° to 42° south).
                                    The portion of the second stock in Brazilian waters is managed independently from the
Southwest Atlantic




                                    AUCFZ. In addition, there are other sources of Argentine hake, which include the Falkland
                                    Islands (Malvinas) stock (Winter and Ramos, 2021).
                                       Argentine hake supports the most important offshore fisheries within the AUCFZ.
                                    Before 1998, landings in Uruguay and Argentina averaged more than 600 000 tonnes
                                    per year per fleet. Subsequently, landings declined steadily and, since 2005, total land-
                                    ings have not exceeded about 400 000 tonnes per year. A rebuilding management plan
                                    was initiated in 2011, including the creation of an assessment working group (CTMFM,
                                    2016). Stock assessments are conducted regularly within the AUCFZ (Lorenzo and Defeo,
                                    2015). Temporary spatial closures and total allowable catches (TACs) are regularly set
                                    (CTMFM, 2020a). Biomass levels are still suboptimal (B2018 < BMSY) (CTMFM, 2020a).
                                    The Patagonian stock appears to be well managed. Results show an increase in the spawn-
                                    ing biomass (estimated by extended survival analysis) close to reference point estimates of
                                    450 000 to 550 000 tonnes (Giussi et al., 2022). Spawning stock biomass estimates have
                                    been consistently above their target reference point since 2013, catches are consistently
                                    below TAC, and fishing mortality of totally recruited ages (F 3–6 years) decreased between
                                    2014 and 2018 (Santos and Villarino, 2022). In Brazil, recent reports suggest that the
                                    stock exploited in southern Brazil is facing overexploitation (Perez and Sant’Ana, 2022).
                                    Sixty percent of catches are landed in Santa Catarina State, Brazil. Stock assessment esti-
                                    mates for Brazil yielded biomasses of 267 700 tonnes and 233 100 tonnes for 2001 and
                                    2002, respectively. In 2004, the Ministry of Environment of Brazil designated this species
                                    as overexploited, but, shortly after, withdrew the resolution following political pressure
                                    (Vaz-dos-Santos and Schwingel, 2015).
                                    4.2 Argentine shortfin squid
                                    The Argentine shortfin squid (Illex argentinus) is a neritic species distributed in the
                                    Southern Atlantic Ocean between 20° and 55° south, frequently occurring between 35°
                                    and 52° south, and influenced by the Malvinas Current (Brunetti et al., 1998; Haimovici et

PART D.6 ■ Regional overview ■ Area 41: Southwest Atlantic                                              157




al., 1998; Allega et al., 2020; Arkhipkin et al., 2022). Coastal areas within 28° to 44° south
are especially suitable most of the year (Crespi-Abril and Baron, 2012). It is distributed
along the continental shelf and upper slope of the region of influence of temperate cold
waters of sub-Antarctic origin and the upwelling of central Southwest Atlantic waters
throughout southeastern Brazil. Its depth range extends from the surface to 800 m. The
number of stocks remains uncertain (Perez et al., 2009), although four sub-stocks have
been suggested based on variations in length at maturity, spawning areas and seasons,
and the distribution of early life stages (Brunetti et al., 1998; Ivanovic et al., 2023); these
stocks are (1) the Summer Spawning stock (SSS), (2) the South Patagonian stock (SPS), (3)
the Bonaerensis-North Patagonian stock (BNS), and (4) the Southern Brazil stock (SBS)
(see additional information in Haimovici et al., 1998; Rodhouse et al., 2013). Argentina
recognizes two main spawning populations as management units (e.g. north and south of
44° south: see Allega et al., 2020). Concerning the SPS spawning site, some authors suggest
that the squid spawn near the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence and egg masses reach southern
Brazil (Rodhouse et al., 2013); however, others favour the hypothesis that spawning
takes place along the Patagonian slope between 45° and 48° south, near or at the core of
the Malvinas Current. Spawning migrations to coastal areas are associated with primary
productivity pulses at the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence front, whereas maturation is mainly
associated with the Malvinas Current (Bazzino et al., 2005; Santos and Haimovici, 2002).
   Argentine shortfin squid is captured by jigging and trawling from southern Brazil to the
Falkland Islands (Malvinas) (Arkhipkin et al., 2022). The resource is primarily exploited
within the Argentinian EEZ, in the AUCFZ, and in international waters. Since 1977,
catches by local and long-range fleets have increased from 2 500 tonnes, and peaking at
over 1.1 million tonnes in 1999. The fishery crashed in 2004 and has since oscillated, with
peaks of around 1 million tonnes in 2007, 2014 and 2015; landings have stayed at low levels
since then. The SPS supports one of the world’s largest squid fisheries (Torres et al., 2020).
The amount of fishing by fleets in the high seas is uncertain (Winter, 2019). In 2021, the
catch by the Falkland Islands (Malvinas) fleet amounted to 1 500 tonnes, while Argentina
and Uruguay ammounted 132 200 tonnes and 6 200 tonnes respectively. In southeastern
and southern Brazil, Haimovici et al. (2008) estimated a biomass of 11 300 tonnes and
41 700 tonnes for the winter–spring season of 2001 and the summer–autumn season of
2002, respectively. No published stock assessments and reference points were found in the
last five years for Brazil (Perez and Sant’Ana, 2022).
   For the SPS, an environmentally dependent surplus production model showed that biomass
estimates ranged from 351 600 tonnes to 685 100 tonnes, therefore above BMSY, and F/
FMSY < 1, suggesting a healthy condition (Wang et al., 2018). Sizes at recruitment and matu-
rity remain stable despite intense commercial exploitation (Arkhipkin et al., 2022). The lack
of size selection in fisheries targeting this short-lived squid is attributed to both jigs and trawls
capturing the full size range of recruited individuals, thereby preventing fisheries-induced
selection on size-dependent traits. With only one cohort present during the growth-phase
fishery, size-related traits are primarily shaped by short-term fluctuations in population density
and environmental factors, including temperature (Arkhipkin et al., 2022). Management
measures agreed between Argentina and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland (hereafter, United Kingdom) are based on effort limitation (Dunne, 2017). There are
no governance bodies or management objectives in place for the high seas of the Southwest
Atlantic. However, a recent data exchange programme between Argentina and the United
Kingdom set the basis for a recent stock assessment (Winter, 2019).
4.3 Whitemouth croaker
The whitemouth croaker (Micropogonias furnieri) is a coastal demersal species distributed
from Veracruz, Mexico (20° north) to the Gulf of San Matías, Argentina (41° south) (Isaac,
1988). Its spatial distribution is explained by the broad range of temperatures and salinities
that this species tolerates. Within Argentinean and Uruguayan waters, whitemouth croaker

                           occur in a wide thermohaline gradient, from 10° C in winter to 23° C in summer, and in
                           salinities of 0–34 practical salinity units (PSU) (CTMFM, 2020b).
Southwest Atlantic




                              Several stocks with some degree of mixing are currently recognized (Pereira et al., 2009;
                           Haimovici et al., 2016). Whitemouth croaker stocks are targeted by small-scale fisheries
                           (bottom gillnets) and by coastal industrial fisheries (gillnets and paired bottom trawls)
                           from southern Brazil to northern Argentina. Stock assessments are conducted regularly
                           within the AUCFZ. Temporary spatial closures to protect spawners and juveniles, a mini-
                           mum landing size, and TACs are set regularly to improve stock status (CTMFM, 2020b).
                           Within the AUCFZ, the species is sustainably fished (F2019 < FMSY), and biomass levels
                           are above target reference points (B2019 > BMSY) (CTMFM, 2020b); whereas in southern
                           Brazil, the stock size has decreased to about 10 percent of its virgin biomass (Haimovici
                           et al., 2021).

                           4.4 Stripped weakfish
                           The stripped weakfish (Cynoscion guatucupa) is endemic to the SWAO. It is distributed
                           from Río de Janeiro, Brazil (22° south) to Chubut, Argentina (41° south), inhabiting
                           shallow (< 50 m) mixohaline and marine coastal waters (Cousseau and Perrota, 2013).
                           Up to three stocks have been suggested (although assessments are only available for two)
                           based on latitudinal differences in population and biological parameters: the southern
                           Brazil-Uruguay stock, the northern bonaerense stock and the southern bonaerense stock
                           (El Rincón) (Volpedo et al., 2007). Due to the poleward reproductive migration of the
                           Brazilian stock, several authors propose that the southern Brazil stock and northern
                           Argentinian stock are connected stocks and should be a single management unit (Vieira
                           and Haimovici, 1997; Volpedo et al., 2009). A single stock could also be feasible, consid-
                           ering the high variability between populations (CTMFM, 2020c). However, stocks are
                           managed separately, primarily for geopolitical reasons.
                              The Brazilian management unit (Santa Catarina-Rio Grande do Sul) withstands high
                           exploitation rates (Cardoso et al., 2022). Even though regulations for bottom trawling
                           (pair and otter trawlers) and gillnet fishing are in place, enforcement is poor. Within the
                           AUCFZ, stripped weakfish are targeted by industrial (bottom pair trawlers) and small-
                           scale (gillnets) fisheries. Stock assessments are conducted regularly in this management
                           unit. Regulations (e.g. minimum landing size) and TACs are set regularly to improve stock
                           status (CTMFM, 2020c). The species is sustainably fished (F2018 < FMSY), and biomass levels
                           are above target reference points (B2018 > BMSY) (CTMFM, 2020c). The management unit
                           of the El Rincón area is managed exclusively by Argentina.

                           4.5 Argentine anchovy
                           The Argentine anchovy (Engraulis anchoita) is a small pelagic fish distributed from Cabo
                           Frío, Brazil (24° south) to Golfo San Jorge, Argentina (47° south). The species inhabits
                           shallow areas and waters beyond the continental slope (CTMFM, 2020d). The existence
                           of two populations southward of 34° south has been postulated: a northern population
                           inhabiting the AUCFZ and the Buenos Aires platform, and a Patagonian population
                           inhabiting between 41° and 47° south. In southern Brazil, two stocks have been suggested,
                           although assessments on these units are not available (Castello, 2005; Carvalho and
                           Castello, 2013): “sanpaulense” and “riograndense”. However, Carvalho and Castello
                           (2013) suggested that the “riograndense” stock may be part of the AUCFZ stock that
                           annually migrates to northern waters in winter.
                              The bonaerense stock (34° to 41° south) is almost exclusively exploited by the offshore
                           and coastal fishing fleets of Argentina (they have been responsible for more than 95 percent
                           of total landings in the last decade), operating in areas within the AUCFZ, but also in
                           coastal waters and in the EEZ between 39° to 41° south. Landings in Argentina averaged
                           20 000 tonnes during the period 1990–2018, representing a minimal fraction of the avail-
                           able biomass. Uruguayan landings are almost negligible, except for 2005 and 2006 when
                           landings reached 9 631 tonnes and 12 890 tonnes, respectively. Stock assessments are
                           conducted regularly within the AUCFZ. TACs are set regularly following a precautionary
PART D.6 ■ Regional overview ■ Area 41: Southwest Atlantic                                      159




approach (CTMFM, 2020d). The stock is sustainably fished (F2018 < FMSY), and biomass
estimates are well above sustainable yield levels (B2018 > BMSY) (CTMFM, 2020d).
4.6 Brazilian sardinella
The Brazilian sardinella (Sardinella brasiliensis) is a pelagic species distributed from
southern Florida (United States of America) to the South American coast. However, the
current recognized distribution of Brazilian sardinella is limited to southeastern Brazil.
Historically, its southern distribution edge was at 29° south (Santa Marta Grande Cape),
but recent reports document catches in shallow waters (30 m depth) between 31° and 33°
south (Catalani, 2017), suggesting a poleward shift likely linked to the intensification
and poleward movement of the Brazilian Current. Gasalla et al. (2017) noted that the
Brazilian sardinella has shifted to colder and deeper waters.
  Brazilian sardinella has been the primary target of the southeastern Brazil seine fish-
ery (23° to 9° south) for decades. Due to uncertainties regarding its distribution and the
inclusion of congeneric species in catch statistics, this species is considered data-limited.
Population collapses in the 1980s and 1990s were attributed to low recruitment driven
by a small spawning stock, heavy fishing pressure, and unfavourable environmental
conditions (Franco et al., 2020). By 2016, the fishery was on the brink of collapse due to
high catch and natural mortality rates, declining primary production, and rising water
temperatures (Schroeder et al., 2024).
4.7 Argentina red shrimp
The Argentine red shrimp (Pleoticus muelleri) is a cool-water species of sub-Antarctic
origin. Its distribution has been mainly driven by the poleward displacement of the
Brazilian Current during the past decades (Gianelli et al., 2023). Abundance is affected by
the South Atlantic Central Water (cold waters at 15 °C), which can lead to a temperature
decrease in deeper areas (> 15 m). There is a positive relationship between Argentine red
shrimp abundance and depth, with an inverse association with bottom temperature
(Castilho et al., 2008). Ocean warming could affect its thermal tolerance and survival,
and could lead to changes in its bathymetric distribution. Abundance is also positively
correlated with salinity and negatively with sediment silt and clay content. The increasing
sedimentation and inflow of fresh water from the continent resulting from changes in
climate and land use could also lead to deleterious effects (Bernardo et al., 2018).
   Argentine red shrimp is harvested throughout its geographic range. This species is
one of the most valued in the international market, and currently provides the highest
economic returns in Area 41. In Argentina, landings by freezer and fresh trawlers have
increased since 2006, up to 255 000 tonnes in 2018 (Giussi et al., 2022). In southern
Brazil, it constitutes a critical trawl fishery in terms of catches and income (Metri and
Perez, 2014). In Uruguay, it is artisanally harvested (Segura and Delgado, 2012). In
Argentina, the management framework is mainly based on recruitment assessment and
its relationship with environmental factors; an onboard observer programme monitors
the bycatch of bony and cartilaginous fish. Minimum harvestable sizes and closed areas
have been established.

5. KEY FINDINGS
Most of the fisheries in Area 41 are primarily targeted by industrial fleets, although
some of the same stocks are also targeted by small-scale fisheries in coastal waters. In this
context, data from industrial fisheries tend to be more reliable than data from small-scale
fisheries. Furthermore, data on valuable export-oriented fisheries resources, most of which
fall under Tier 1 categorization, are likely to be more reliable compared to less valuable
species, some of which are grouped under Tier 2. Overall, there have been significant
improvements in the taxonomic resolution of species data. For example, the volume of
catch classified as “marine fishes nei” (not elsewhere included) has decreased since the 1987
41                   160                                                          Review of the state of world marine fishery resources




                           peak. Although the taxonomic status of some stocks was updated during the consultation
                           process, inconsistencies in the global FAO database remain.
Southwest Atlantic




                              The updated assessment shows that 42.0 percent of stocks in Area 41 are overfished,
                           43.5 percent are maximally sustainably fished, and 14.5 percent are underfished. These
                           findings are broadly consistent with assessments under the previous methodology
                           (TABLE D.6.4 and TABLE D.6.5), but they offer improved resolution and have fostered regional
                           collaboration. In addition, the coverage of assessed stocks accounted for 85.4 percent
                           of landings in 2021, a significant increase in comparison with 68.4 percent of landings
                           assessed with the previous methodology in 2021. The participatory approach to categoriz-
                           ing stocks into tiers based on data availability was highly effective. Beyond the similarity
                           of the outcomes, the strength of using the updated methodology lies in several aspects:
                           (1) it aligns more closely with the realities of the fisheries development situation in Area
                           41 and globally, (2) it encompasses a significant increase in the number of exploited
                           stocks within the Area, and (3) the participatory process adds realism, confidence, and
                           strengthens estimations, while simultaneously fostering interaction among countries.
                           These estimates should be enhanced by incorporating stocks, potentially classified as
                           Tier 3, that are targeted by small-scale fisheries with a critical socioeconomic role for local
                           communities. This is particularly important for fisheries operating along the northern
                           coasts of Brazil, although the approach should not be limited to this region.
                              The asymmetry in information among FAO subareas within Area 41 is also evident,
                           with the majority of identified and assessed stocks distributed from subarea 41.2.1
                           (20° south) to subarea 41.3.2 (60° south). Tier 1 stocks located in southern Brazil, and
                           those jointly managed by Argentina and Uruguay in the AUCFZ, are regularly assessed
                           using age-based integrated stock assessment models. In many cases, these assessments
                           undergo routine peer-review processes conducted by scientific groups. Consequently,
                           robust quality control mechanisms are in place for Tier 1 stock assessments in these FAO
                           subareas. However, differences were observed in the quality and quantity of informa-
                           tion based on the fisheries complexity and data systems when comparing stocks in these
                           subareas to those primarily located in the north and northeast of Brazilian waters (e.g.
                           41.1.1 to 41.1.4). Additional analyses are needed to assess the status of stocks in northern
                           Brazil to provide a comprehensive understanding of the stock situation across the entire
                           region. Using different auxiliary effort data gave conflicting stock assessment results for
                           northern Brazilian stocks, indicating that more research was needed.
                              The updated FAO approach aligns stock assessments with ecological realities and
                           regional bioregionalization schemes to address data inconsistencies. Indeed, many of the
                           stocks categorized in Tiers 1 and 2 in this document broadly align with the distribution of
                           FAO subareas and the bioregionalization scheme for coastal and shelf areas proposed by
                           Spalding et al. (2007). Specifically, Tier 1 and Tier 2 stocks are primarily distributed and
                           exploited within FAO subareas 41.2.1 (Santos), 41.2.2 (Rio Grande) and 41.2.3 (Platense)
                           of Area 41 (Figure 1). While these FAO subareas are not identical, they correspond to
                           the Southeastern Brazil, Rio Grande, and Rio de la Plata/Uruguay-Buenos Aires Shelf
                           ecoregions within the Warm Temperate Southwestern Atlantic Province (Spalding et al.,
                           2007). Similarly, stocks in subareas 41.3.1, 41.3.2 and 41.3.3 predominantly inhabit the
                           Magellanic Province and its associated ecoregions.
                              Regional collaboration and expert integration are essential for developing strategies that
                           reflect the spatial and temporal complexity of fisheries. Sustainability depends on holistic
                           management that supports ecosystem health and socioeconomic stability for dependent
                           communities. Transboundary species highlight the urgent need for a regional approach
                           that integrates science and governance to establish cohesive frameworks (Gianelli et al.,
                           2023; Defeo et al., 2025). Given that there is no regional fisheries management organi-
                           zation in the Southwest Atlantic, the FAO-led participatory framework for categorizing
                           the state of the stocks at the regional level is a critical step toward informing policies for
                           effective regional fisheries management. Additional efforts might be needed to refine
                           taxonomic resolution, and prioritize key fisheries across jurisdictions, as well as to assess
PART D.6 ■ Regional overview ■ Area 41: Southwest Atlantic                                                                                                                                                                 161




smaller stocks, and enhance their time series. This ongoing, adaptive process is essential
for addressing challenges posed by diverse fishery dynamics and fostering the sustaina-
bility of resources and livelihoods in the Southwest Atlantic.
   Finally, refining methodologies to incorporate long-term data, improve taxonomic
resolution, and prioritize key fisheries across jurisdictions is crucial. An adaptive process
is needed to address fishery complexities and ensure the sustainability of resources and
livelihoods in the Southwest Atlantic.

  Fisheries are a thriving industry and provide employment to many
   in the region.
  Fisheries are especially significant in terms of food security and
   livelihoods to millions, especially in the northern part of this region.
  Management is focused on rebuilding recently overfished large
   commercial stocks and improving enforcement and monitoring.
  In recent years, information on many more stocks became available.
  Protection of areas important to maintaining viable fisheries, such as
   spawning and nursing grounds, has been strengthened.

1. OVERVIEW
The Southeast Atlantic, designated by FAO as Major Fishing Area 47 (hereafter, Area 47),
encompasses the exclusive economic zones (EEZ) of Angola (except for the Cabinda
province exclave which forms part of Area 34), Namibia and South Africa, and extends
well into the high seas to the south and west (FIGURE D.7.1). The islands of Saint Helena,

                           Ascension and Tristan da Cunha also fall within Area 47. The region covers a total surface
                           area of about 18 million km2 , with less than 0.5 million km2 being shelf area. The high
Southeast Atlantic




                           productivity of this region can mostly be attributed to the Benguela upwelling system.
                              The EEZs of Area 47 are dominated by two main current systems: the southward-flow-
                           ing warm Angola Current (Kirkman and Nsingi, 2019) and the northward-flowing
                           temperate Benguela Current. The Agulhas and Benguela currents meet around Cape
                           Agulhas, on the southern tip of Africa. The northward flowing Benguela meets the
                           southward flowing Angola current to form the Angola-Benguela Front (ABF). The rela-
                           tive position of the ABF (FIGURE D.7.2) moves seasonally, being located further north
                           during the cold season (May to October) and displacing south during the warm season
                           (November to April). The two current systems define two relatively well-defined ecosys-
                           tems: the Angola subtropical warm ecosystem, with relatively high diversity and moderate
                           resource abundance in the north; and the Benguela temperate upwelling ecosystem,
                           characterized by lower diversity but higher abundance of fishery resources, in the south.
                              The Benguela ecosystem can be subdivided into the northern Benguela and the south-
                           ern Benguela, separated near the town of Lüderitz by the Lüderitz cell, the most intensive
                           wind-induced upwelling cell in the world (Bakun, 1996). The Benguela Current Large
                           Marine Ecosystem (BCLME) covers the Atlantic coast of the three countries, including
                           the two current systems in the Area (FIGURE D.7.2).
                              The region is periodically affected by the “Benguela Niño,” which occurs periodically
                           at irregular intervals of about once per decade. These events are characterized by abnor-
                           mally high sea surface temperatures along the coasts of Angola and Namibia, which can
                           significantly impact the climate, marine ecosystems, and fisheries in the Area (Shannon
                           et al., 1986; Imbol Koungue et al., 2019)

                           2. FISHERY PROFILES

                           2.1 General
                           Area 47 is one of the most productive fishing grounds in the world. Reported catches in
                           this Area peaked in 1978 at around 3.3 million tonnes and have since plateaued at around
                           1.5 million tonnes per year (FIGURE D.7.3). This Area accounted for 1.8 percent (1.5 million
                           tonnes) of total declared global marine capture production in 2021 (80 million tonnes)
                           (FAO, 2024c).
                              The majority of the catch by tonnage in the region is landed by industrial and semi-in-
                           dustrial fisheries, which operate mostly on the shelf and at the shelf edge (i.e. trawl,
                           purse-seine and longline). This region also supports a large proportion of artisanal and
                           small-scale fisheries (SSF). The coast is generally exposed to wave action and dangerous
                           for landing fishing vessels. Vessels land mostly at more or less sheltered locations across
                           the region.
                              Landings are dominated by small pelagic fish (Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax), sard-
                           inellas, European anchovy [Engraulis encrasicolus], round herring [Etrumeus teres] and
                           Atlantic horse mackerel [Trachurus trachurus]); these represent more than 42 percent of
                           the declared landings of the last five years. Two hake species are second in terms of amount
                           landed. Among the small pelagics, sardine used to be the dominant species in terms of
                           landings, mostly from Namibia, although the Namibian stock collapsed between the late
                           1960s and early 1970s (Boyer and Hampton, 2001).
                              The level and scope of fisheries management differs between the three countries in the
                           region. Some of these differences arise from the nature of the fisheries and the history of
                           the three countries, shaped by colonial legacies and the industrial development of fisheries.
                           In all three countries, fishing licences are required for all commercial fishing (industrial,
                           semi-industrial and artisanal). Fisheries management is based on an annual cycle, and the
                           combined use of effort and landings control with technical measures like minimum sizes
                           and space and time closures. Industrial and semi-industrial fisheries for the main resources
                           are mostly managed with a total allowable catch (TAC) and quota system, with total

                           survey process and accounted for when setting TACs for the larger-scale fleet segments,
                           others have catch reporting schemes similar to larger, industrial fleets.
                              Additionally, the three countries are parties to the Benguela Current Convention,
                           which established the Benguela Current Commission (BCC) in 2007 as a permanent
                           intergovernmental organization. The BCC is the first intergovernmental commission
                           based on the Large Marine Ecosystem concept of ocean governance, and aims at coordi-
                           nating multi-sectoral management of the BCLME.
                              All three countries make intensive use of scientific surveys at sea (including through
                           cooperation with the EAF-Nansen programme) to monitor the state of the main fishery
                           resources, and they also monitor the landings of the main target species from the large-
                           scale commercial industrial fisheries. Only limited monitoring of non-target species from
                           the large commercial fisheries is performed. With the exception of South Africa, the
                           countries do not have the means to monitor in detail the artisanal, small-scale fisheries
                           or semi-industrial fisheries that do not have long-standing or detailed catch information.
                           South Africa also conducts its own fisheries independent surveys in addition to those of
                           the EAF Nansen programme.
                           2.2 Angola
                           The Republic of Angola has a coastline of 1 700 km and an EEZ of 500 000 km2 . Almost
                           all of the coastline (the exception being the Cabinda province exclave in the north that
                           falls within FAO Major Fishing Area 34) falls within Area 47. The entire coast of Angola
                           is located within the BCLME. Capture fisheries currently contribute 3–5 percent of gross
                           domestic product ( GDP), with a very important contribution to the food and nutritional
                           security of the Angolan population (FAO, 2025).
                               Angolan fisheries include all sectors of fishing: industrial, semi-industrial, artisanal
                           and subsistence. All these sub-sectors operate along the whole coast. The industrial fleet
                           lands almost exclusively in the industrial fishing ports of Luanda, Lobito and Namibe,
                           while the semi-industrial – and even more the artisanal – fleets land at more or less shel-
                           tered locations along the coastline.
                               Fishing zones in Angola can be divided into three geographically distinct fishing zones
                           (Lankester, 2002; Soares and Jabado, 2024). The southern fishing zone, from Lobito to
                           the mouth of the Cunene River, is the most productive. Species richness in this zone
                           is greatest at depths of about 100 m, comprising horse mackerel, sardines, tunas, and a
                           range of demersal species including sea breams, hakes, groupers and croakers. The central
                           fishing zone, extending from Luanda to Lobito, yields mainly sardinellas, horse mackerel
                           and several demersal species (hakes, groupers and seabreams). The northern fishing zone,
                           extending from the mouth of the Congo River to Luanda, includes large populations of
                           horse mackerel and sardinellas and a smaller proportion of demersal species.
                               The industrial fleet includes mostly purse-seiners and bottom trawlers, but there are also
                           pelagic and semi-pelagic trawlers, longliners and trap vessels. The semi-industrial fleet is
                           dominated by purse-seiners, with some longliners, bottom trawlers, trap vessels and other
                           types of vessels. The artisanal fleet, on the other hand, includes vessels using almost all
                           kinds of gear, mostly passive gear like handlines, longlines and gillnets.
                               Angola has a high per-capita consumption of fish, and most of the fish landed is used
                           for domestic consumption. Additionally, Angola imports significant amounts of small
                           pelagic fish to satisfy internal demand.

2.3 Namibia
The Republic of Namibia has a coastline of about 1 600 km and an EEZ of 540 000 km2 .
This coastline falls entirely within Area 47 and within the BCLME region. Capture
fisheries currently contribute about 2.6 percent of GDP, and over 10 percent of export
earnings (NSA, 2021).
   The Namibian marine fisheries sector includes commercial, recreational and subsistence
fisheries. There are about 20 commercial fishery species in Namibia. Some of these species
are regulated by the setting of annual TACs: horse mackerel, hake, monkfish (also known
as devil anglerfish, Lophius vomerinus), Pacific sardine, orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlan-
ticus), rock lobster, and crab, among others. Pilchard and orange roughy are currently in a
moratorium while other commercial bycatch species are regulated through effort control
and bycatch levies as derived from the landed value. Commercial fishing, especially the
industrial sub-segment, takes place along the whole coast. Hake, monkfish and adult horse
mackerel are present along the entire coast, while sardine, crab and juvenile horse mackerel
are mainly in the north. Most of the recreational fishing activities are concentrated in the
central area as large parts of the northern and southern areas are closed to recreational
fishing. Commercial landings take place at Walvis Bay (the largest port) and Lüderitz.
   Most of the industrial commercial vessels are bottom trawlers, purse seiners and midwa-
ter trawlers, with a lower number of longliners or handliners. The line fisheries are primarily
small-scale fisheries in this Area. There is also a dedicated crab and lobster trap fishery.
Most of the fish caught in Namibia is exported, as domestic fish consumption is limited.
2.4 South Africa
The Republic of South Africa has a coastline of over 3 000 km and an EEZ of just over
1 000 000 km2 . Most of the coastline falls within Area 47, although the easternmost
part of the coastline is part of the Western Indian Ocean (Area 51). The whole coast of
South Africa is considered to be within the BCLME. Capture fisheries in South Africa
contribute less than 1 percent of GDP but constitute an important sector for food security,
employment and culture, especially in the west and south coasts.
   The South African marine fisheries sector includes large-scale commercial, artisanal,
recreational and subsistence fisheries, which take place along the entire coast. Industrial
vessels primarily land at fishing ports on the West Coast, St. Helena Bay, Saldanha
Bay, Cape Town, and the South Coast posts of Mossel Bay and Port Elizabeth. Smaller
commercial vessels also land at other smaller landing ports, including Port Nolloth,
Hondeklip, Laaiplek, Hout Bay, Kalk Bay, Gansbaai, Hermanus and East London. Small-
scale and artisanal fishers operate in almost 150 fishing communities along the coast.
   Commercial fisheries include demersal and midwater trawl, purse-seine, demersal and
pelagic longline, lobster pot, tuna pole-and-line, squid jig, and traditional line fishing. The
small pelagic fishery uses purse seines and is the largest fishery by tonnage, with catches
dominated by anchovy, followed by sardine and round herring. These contribute about
25 percent of the country’s catch value. The fishery sectors which contribute the largest
catch value are deep-sea demersal trawling and demersal longlining, both targeting hake.
These contribute on average over 40 percent of total catch value, roughly equal to all other
South African marine fisheries combined. Although the crustacean and squid jig fishery
catches are comparatively small, they account for 15 percent of all catch value.
   South Africa has both an active domestic market for fish products and an export
market. A large part of the catch from the industrial fisheries is exported, while most of
the products from the artisanal and small-scale fishing is sold on the domestic market.
2.5 Areas beyond national jurisdiction
The high seas under the South East Atlantic Fisheries Organization (SEAFO) cover most
of Area 47 (with the exception of the EEZs of coastal states). Fisheries in the high seas
include mostly those targeting tuna and tuna-like species, and those targeting demersal
resources like deep-water red crab (Chaceon quinquedens), orange roughy and other
deep-water resources. Both groups of fisheries are targeted by an international distant-wa-
ter fleet as well as by some vessels from the coastal nations.

                           2.6 British Overseas Territories
                           The British Overseas Territories of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha have
Southeast Atlantic




                           very specific fishery types. In those islands, rock lobster is the main focus of fisheries,
                           contributing 80 percent of declared catches in 2021, followed by tunas (FAO, 2024b).
                           Saint Helena’s tuna fishery promotes pole-and-line fishing. Ascension collects licence
                           fees from commercial longline tuna vessels operating under fishing quotas issued by the
                           International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). Ascension
                           Island has designated all of its EEZ as a marine protected area (MPA), while Tristan da
                           Cunha has declared 91 percent of its EEZ as an MPA (Tristan da Cunha Government
                           and Tristan da Cunha Association, 2020).

                           The reference list for Area 47 includes 81 assessed stocks, representing 70 distinct species
                           (TABLE D.7.1 and APPENDIX II, TABLE 7, pp. 432). Of these, 39 (48.1 percent) are considered
                           Tier 1 (with formal assessments), 36 (44.4 percent) Tier 2 (assessed with surplus-pro-
                           duction model approaches), and only 6 (7.4 percent) were Tier 3 stocks (assessed using
                           data-limited approaches). The updated methodology covers 93.8 percent of the total
                           declared landings for Area 47 in 2021, an increase from 84.6 percent.

                              Of these 81 stocks, 33.3 percent were classified as underfished, 24.7 percent as maxi-
                           mally sustainably fished, and 42.0 percent as overfished in 2021 (TABLE D.7.2). Accordingly,
                           it is estimated that 58.0 percent of the stocks can be classified as sustainable, while
                           42.0 percent are classified as unsustainable in 2021.
                              The distribution of stocks among the three status categories was not the same for all
                           tiers (TABLE D.7.2). Tier 2 tended to have a higher percentage of stocks classified as under-
                           fished and overfished compared to Tier 1. The very low number of stocks from Tier 3 does
                           not warrant any meaningful comparison regarding their distribution across the status
                           categories.
                              While the overall proportion of sustainably fished stocks (those that are maximally
                           sustainably fished and underfished) remains relatively unchanged, the distribution
                           between underfished and maximally sustainably fished has shifted significantly under

the updated methodology, with 33.3 percent rated as underfished and 24.7 percent
as maximally sustainably fished in 2021 with the updated methodology, compared to
0 percent and 59.5 percent respectively for the same year with the previous methodology
(TABLE D.7.4). This shift is largely due to the inclusion of several new stocks – primar-
ily species that are either caught as bycatch or not actively targeted but hold important
cultural and ecological value, many of which are rated as underfished. These species are
mostly incidental catches within trawl fisheries. In contrast, the artisanal line fishery and
small-scale fisheries do not produce bycatch, as all catch is utilized. Notably, none of the
species in these small-scale fisheries, and few of the commercially targeted stocks included
in the updated assessment, are considered underfished.

(TABLE D.7.3), stocks classified as underfished comprise 5.9 percent of the total landings
accounted for by the assessed stocks, while those classified as maximally sustainably fished
account for 37.9 percent, and those classified as overfished account for 56.2 percent of the
total landings of the assessed stocks. Accordingly, stocks classified as sustainable account

                                       4. KEY SELECTED SPECIES AND GROUPS
Southeast Atlantic




                                       This section identifies and discusses species and stocks that are currently most important
                                       for Area 47 (FIGURE D.7.3).
                                       4.1 Small pelagic fishes
                                       Small pelagic fishes are important in the region (FIGURE D.7.3). They are of high value, a
                                       high-quality source of protein, and occupy an important role in the marine food web
                                       since they are the forage fish that provide the link between plankton and larger-bodied
                                       predatory fish (DFFE, 2023). Acquiring a stock status for these species can prove diffi-
                                       cult as they are characterized by inherent and high levels of natural variability. Careful
                                       management of these species is vital due to the key role they play within the BCLME.
                                       South Africa manages small-pelagic stocks through Operational Management Procedures
                                       (OMPs). An OMP is an adaptive management approach that uses a simulation-tested
                                       set of rules and pre-specified data, stock assessment methods and harvest control rules to
                                       determine and implement management actions (i.e. TAC).
                                          In Namibia, catches of small pelagic fish peaked at 1.5 million tonnes in 1968, domi-
                                       nated by sardine, but collapsed shortly after (Paterson, Kirchner and Ommer, 2013). In
                                       Angola, sardinellas are an important pelagic fish stock, fished by purse-seining and used
                                       almost exclusively for human consumption. In South Africa, the purse-seine fishery is the
                                       largest fishery in terms of landed mass and second only to hake in terms of value (DFFE,
                                       2023). Ninety-five percent of its landings are European anchovy [(Engraulis encrasicolus)
                                       also known as Southern African anchovy (Engraulis capensis)], Pacific sardine (Sardinops
                                       sagax) and Whitehead’s round herring (Etrumeus whiteheadi) (DFFE, 2023). Overall,
                                       most sardines in Area 47 are overfished with one stock maximally sustainably fished.
                                       Anchovy and Whitehead’s round herring are considered maximally sustainably fished.
                                          Cape horse mackerel (Trachurus capensis) is a major target species in South Africa,
                                       Namibia and southern Angola. It is commonly accepted that there are two stocks, a north-
                                       ern stock distributed along northern Namibia and southern Angola, and a southern stock
                                       in the extreme south of Namibia and South Africa, separated by the Luderitz upwelling
                                       cell. Cunene horse mackerel (Trachurus trecae) is a main target species in the region. It is
                                       associated with the Angola Current ecosystem, and is distributed along the whole coast

of Angola, extending to the northern part of Namibia with a higher proportion there
during the cold season. The stock of Cunene horse mackerel is classified as overfished,
while the two stocks of Cape horse mackerel are classified as maximally sustainably fished.
4.2 Hake
Shallow-water Cape hake (Merluccius capensis) and deep-water Cape hake (Merluccius
paradoxus) are important economic stocks for Namibia and South Africa. They are
also captured in small amounts in the south of Angola, together with Benguela hake
(Merluccius polli) that is fished along the whole Angolan coast.
   In South Africa, these stocks are targeted through multiple sectors (trawl, longline,
handline) but the deep-sea trawl sector lands the most. Approximately 80 percent of all
hake landed in the past decade in South Africa has been deep-water hake. Approximately
60 percent of the South African hake catch is exported, and the main markets are in
Europe, Australia and the United States of America (SADSTIA, 2024). Since 1991,
South African hake stocks have been managed through OMPs, similarly to small pelagic
stocks. These OMPs regulate and attribute the hake TAC by sector.
   In Namibia, hake is also an important economic resource. Most of the hake landed
is exported. Hake is targeted by longline and bottom trawl. The stocks of shallow-water
Cape hake and deep-water Cape hake are assessed and managed separately in Namibia
and South Africa. Most stocks of hake are classified as overfished, although two stocks
are considered underfished.
4.3 Lobster
West coast rock lobster or Cape rock lobster (Jasus lalandii) is endemic to the BCLME.
Rock lobster is caught using baited traps off vessels. Catches peaked in the 1950s at over
25 000 tonnes, and then collapsed due to overfishing and changes in environmental
conditions (Grobler and Noli-Peard, 1997). They have not shown any sign of recovery
since. Two lobster stocks are overfished and one is maximally sustainably fished.
   In South Africa, the Cape rock lobster resource is harvested inshore by hoop nets from
small wooden rowing boats and then offshore by trap vessels. This resource is important
to coastal communities and its decline has resulted in economic hardships for most fish-
ers on the West Coast (DFFE, 2023). South Africa’s southeast coast also has an endemic
population of Southern spiny lobster (Palinurus gilchristi). This fishery operates using
longlines and traps and is now the largest rock-lobster fishery in South Africa. Lobster
is also key to fishing activities in the British overseas territories, and there is a processing
factory on Tristan da Cunha for St. Paul rock lobster (Jasus paulensis).
4.4 Monkfish
Two stocks of monkfish occur off the Namibian coast – Cape monkfish or devil anglerfish
(Lophius vomerinus) – making up 99 percent of commercial landings. Monkfish started
as a bycatch species from the hake fishery but now has a directed demersal trawl fishery
and is assessed annually using an age-structured population model (Kathena et al., 2018).
The resource is currently underfished. It is an important food source in Namibia and has
important export value.
4.5 Squid
The Angolan flying squid (Todarodes angolensis) is found all along the Namibian coast
and is caught as bycatch in demersal and mid-water trawl fisheries. Catches were at their
lowest in the late 1980s but peaked in 2002 to 2003 at around 1 000 tonnes. In South
Africa, a different species – the Cape Hope squid (Loligo renaudii), commonly referred
to as “chokka”– is caught. There is a targeted commercial jig fishery that operates using
handheld jigs and is labour-intensive. It employs about 3 000 people and is South Africa’s
third-largest fishery in terms of value. Most of the squid is frozen at sea in small blocks
and is then exported to European countries. It is to a lesser extent used locally as bait by
linefishers. Squid is also caught as bycatch in the trawl fishery, with catches of 200 to
800 tonnes annually. The stock is managed using TAE. Overall, squid stocks in Area 47
are classified as underfished or maximally sustainably fished.

                           4.6 Sharks
                           South Africa has one shark-directed fishery, the demersal shark longline fishery, which
Southeast Atlantic




                           targets smooth-hound (Mustelus mustelus) and soupfin shark (also known as tope shark,
                           Galeorhinus galeus). In addition, two shark species represent considerable bycatch in the
                           large pelagic longline fishery, namely blue shark (Prionace glauca) and shortfin mako
                           shark (Isurus oxyrinchus). Finally some shark and ray species are sometimes also retained
                           as bycatch species in the inshore and offshore trawl fishery for hake, as well as in the
                           commercial line fishery. Recent assessments have enabled the stocks of slime skates
                           (Dipturus pullopunctatus) and Saint Joseph sharks (also known as Cape elephantfish,
                           Callorhinchus capensis) to be classified as underfished; smooth-hound, blue and shortfin
                           mako sharks are maximally sustainably fished; yellow-spotted skate (Leucoraja wallacei),
                           and soupfin shark are overfished. The exploitation status of several stocks of skate and of
                           some shark species is still unknown. Many species are caught as bycatch and the risk of
                           overfishing is exacerbated by the disaggregation of catches across many fisheries and the
                           resultant uncertainty in catch and effort time series. Due to substantial efforts to reduce
                           bycatch in the large pelagic longline fishery, it is estimated that the inshore trawl fishery
                           is now responsible for 60 percent of total fishing mortality of sharks and rays in South
                           Africa (DFFE, 2023). Deep-water and shallow-water and pelagic sharks are also landed
                           in Namibia, although their abundance and numbers are not monitored.
                              Sharks and rays are caught across Angola’s commercial and artisanal fisheries, yet there
                           are no species-specific catch records (Soares and Jabado, 2024). Catches across indus-
                           trial fleets are unknown and there is no requirement for fisheries to report on levels of
                           bycatch (Soares and Jabado, 2024). In the absence of species-specific catch information,
                           local ecological knowledge surveys currently represent the best available approach to
                           understand small-scale elasmobranch fisheries in Angola. These surveys highlight that
                           fishers target rays and guitarfishes but that sharks are mainly caught as bycatch (Soares
                           and Jabado, 2024).
                            5. KEY FINDINGS
                           The overall status of fish stocks in Area 47 exhibits varying levels of exploitation, with
                           some stocks maximally sustainably exploited and others under significant pressure due
                           to overfishing. Indicators of key commercial species, such as hake (Merluccius spp.) and
                           horse mackerel (Trachurus spp.), showed declining trends in recent years. Other stocks
                           of small pelagic resources such as sardinella (Sardinella spp.) are declining due to lower
                           recruitment as a function of environmental/climate changes. However, in cases where
                           effective management measures were enforced, stocks recovered and presented a continued
                           increase in the spawning biomass.
                              Across all 81 stocks assessed, 42.0 percent were considered overfished, 24.7 percent
                           maximally sustainably fished and 33.3 percent underfished in 2021 (TABLE D.7.4). With
                           the previous methodology, 40.5 percent of stocks were overfished, 59.5 percent were maxi-
                           mally sustainably fished, and no stocks underfished in 2021.
                              While the overall proportion of sustainably fished stocks (those that are maximally
                           sustainably fished and underfished) remains relatively unchanged, the distribution within
                           these categories has shifted significantly in the latest assessment. This shift is largely due
                           to the inclusion of several new stocks – primarily species that are either caught as bycatch
                           or not actively targeted but hold important cultural and ecological value. These species
                           are mostly incidental catches within trawl fisheries. In contrast, the artisanal line fishery
                           and small-scale fisheries do not produce bycatch, as all catch is utilized. Notably, none of
                           the species in these small-scale fisheries are considered underfished.
                              In addition, the coverage of 93.8 percent of landings has increased significantly in
                           comparison with 84.6 percent of landings assessed with the previous methodology in
                           2021. When weighted by production levels, biologically sustainable stocks account for

43.8 percent of the 2021 landings of assessed stocks monitored by FAO, a decrease if
compared with the previous methodology (TABLE D.7.5). This is due partially to the inclu-
sion of the landings of stocks of Merluccius spp., Trachurus spp. and Sardinella spp. that
are estimated to be overfished.
   Fisheries management in the region is governed by a combination of national and
regional frameworks each playing critical roles. However, despite these efforts, compli-
ance with regulations remains uneven. In some countries, there are agreed management
procedures for small pelagics and hake resources that are regularly updated, while in
others there is an ongoing process to develop and implement such procedures. Once
fully established, these procedures are expected to improve the long-term sustainability
of these resources in the face of climate change, while also increasing the overall propor-
tion of sustainable landings.

1. OVERVIEW
The Western Indian Ocean (WIO), designated by FAO as Major Fishing Area 51 (hereaf-
ter, Area 51), is a vast and diverse fishing area encompassing the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf,
the Arabian Sea, and the waters off the east coast of Africa. It is home to a wide variety of
marine ecosystems and supports numer-
ous fisheries, both large and small-scale.
Area 51 covers 29.3 million km2 , which               FIGURE D.8.1
is about 8.1 percent of the global marine             FAO MAJOR FISHING AREA 51:
fishing area. The region’s continental                THE WESTERN INDIAN OCEANC
shelf (< 200 m depth) is generally narrow
(only around 6 percent of the total area),
particularly off the east African main-                                         51.2
land, but is wider off the northwest coast
of India and the Arabian Gulf region.                       51.1
   The Area includes over 30 countries/
territories: Bahrain, Chagos Archipelago,                                                  51.3

Maldives, Mauritius, Mozambique,
Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia,
Seychelles, Somalia, South Africa (east
coast), Sudan, United Arab Emirates,

and Yemen. About 42 percent of the
region is under national jurisdiction, the
remainder being areas beyond national                                           51.6

                             (subarea 51.7), and Mozambique and east coast South Africa (subarea 51.8).
                                Area 51 accounted for around 7 percent (5.5 million tonnes) of total global marine
                             production in 2021.
                                Fisheries in ABNJ are managed by two regional fisheries management organizations
                             (RFMOs): the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), which is responsible for the
                             management of highly-migratory tuna and tuna-like species in the Indian Ocean; and
                             the Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement (SIOFA), which is responsible for the
                             management of non-highly migratory species in ABNJ. In addition, there are two regional
                             commissions: a) the Southwest Indian Ocean Fisheries Commission (SWIOFC), which
                             is a regional fishery body providing advice on resources of the southwest Indian Ocean
                             distributed in the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of the member countries (Comoros,
                             France, Kenya, Madagascar, Maldives, Mauritius, Mozambique, Seychelles, Somalia,
                             South Africa (east coast), the United Republic of Tanzania, Zanzibar, and Yemen), and
                             b) the Regional Commission for Fisheries (RECOFI) which fulfills a similar role for the
                             Gulf states – Bahrain, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Saudi
                             Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (FIGURE D.8.2). There is also a project underway to
                             develop a Red Sea Fisheries Commission in the next few years.
                                Area 51 also includes a portion of ABNJ which are not monitored by any of the RFMOs
                             in the region – with the exception of tuna and tuna-like species which are covered by
                             IOTC – and in which distant-water fishing nations exploit several ABNJ resources.
                                The disparity in upwelling and associated oceanographic productivity between the
                             northern and southern regions of Area 51 accounts for substantial differences in fisheries
                             catches between the two. In the north during summer, monsoon productivity is enhanced
                             by the Somali Current upwelling system which also affects Oman, the southwest coast
                             of India, and the wider Arabian Sea. In contrast, during the winter monsoon, productiv-
                             ity is driven by convective mixing and is mostly confined to the northern Arabian Sea.

Apart from these northern/northwestern areas, the majority of Area 51 has low produc-
tivity (Marsac et al., 2024). Catches in India, in particular, are much higher than in other
countries of the region.
   A wide diversity of species and stocks (about 500) are harvested using a wide variety of
fishing gear. Small-scale fisheries contribute substantially to catches, and marine resources
are extremely important for food security. While a large proportion of stocks are mainly
caught by industrial/semi-industrial fisheries, an even greater proportion are caught by
both small-scale and industrial/semi-industrial fisheries; there is a much smaller compo-
nent of stocks that are mainly caught by small-scale fisheries.
   Fleets belonging to Area 51 countries have a high proportion of small vessels, either
motorized or non-motorized; non-motorized vessels account for around 39 percent of all
fishing vessels, with few vessels > 24 m being reported, though there are reporting prob-
lems. Fishing effort is dominated by trawls, beach seines, gillnets, longlines and purse
seines (Watson, 2017; Murua et al., 2019).

2. FISHERY PROFILES
This section discusses the region’s fisheries and fish stock status based on the RFMO
regions. The marked disparities between the RECOFI and SWIOFC regions (see below)
mean they can be described separately, with further separate consideration of India and
Pakistan which do not belong to an RFMO. The ABNJ fisheries falling under IOTC and
SIOFA are also considered separately. Some countries in Area 51 have not reported any
fisheries updates in recent years. India (west coast) and Pakistan together with RECOFI
nations account for over 70 percent of the 5.5 million tonnes of landings of aquatic
animals reported by 42 countries/territories for Area 51 in 2021 (FIGURE D.8.3).

                                      2.1 India and Pakistan – Subarea 51.4
Western Indian Ocean




                                      These countries comprise a substantial part of the coastline of Area 51; the fisheries of
                                      the Southeastern Arabian Sea (SEAS) differ from those of the Northeastern Arabian
                                      Sea (NEAS) due to physical oceanographic characteristics. Although the fish catches
                                      are similar in both regions, the catch composition is different. This is largely due to
                                      monsoon rainfall which affects the numerous rivers flowing into the Arabian Sea, as well
                                      as southwesterly winds that drive upwelling along the coast during the monsoon, resulting
                                      in high productivity, which, in turn, drives the abundance of small pelagics (sardines,
                                      mackerel and anchovies), particularly in the SEAS. The NEAS, on the other hand, is
                                      influenced by higher-trophic-level demersal predators. Overall, different oceanographic
                                      characteristics give rise to small pelagic planktivorous species in the south, with higher
                                      trophic and carnivorous species in the north. However, it’s important to remember
                                      that this is a simplification of a complex ecological system, and that there are overlaps,
                                      variations with depth and season, and the influence of fishing pressure to consider before
                                      reaching conclusions.
                                         A very high number of fishers and fishing vessels are concentrated in this region. The
                                      principal fisheries include small-scale demersal, small pelagic, semi-industrial deep-sea,
                                      trawl and tuna (Sathianandan et al., 2013; Patil et al., 2018). The region contributes land-
                                      ings of > 2 million tonnes annually (more than a third of landings in Area 51). Being in
                                      the tropics, there is high diversity in the harvests, with more than 1 200 species identi-
                                      fied (Sathianandan et al., 2013). The catches of cephalopods, croakers, anchovies, jacks
                                      and natantian decapods have been relatively stable in recent decades. On the other hand,
                                      landings of small pelagics (Indian oil sardine, clupeids and mackerel) are highly variable.

2.3 Southwest Indian Ocean Fisheries Commission (SWIOFC) – Subareas
51.5, 51.6 and 51.8
The 12 riparian countries of this region of Area 51 include Small Island Developing States
(SIDS) where people and cultures are greatly influenced by the sea; the importance of the
ocean and its fisheries to SWIOFC countries cannot be overstated (van der Elst et al., 2005)
and some of the world’s poorest countries occur in the SWIOFC region (UNDP, 2020). In
SWIOFC countries, small-scale fisheries account for most of the catches. These fisheries are
critical for livelihoods, nutrition and income (Temple et al., 2024). The harvest includes a
wide variety of species including invertebrates and fishes that inhabit reefs, seagrass beds and
shallow inshore waters, while there is limited industrial fishing by SWIOFC countries in
deeper waters of the outer continental shelf and upper slope, in the form of bottom trawling
and traps for crustaceans (WIOFish, 2024). Substantial numbers of coastal fishers make
use of artisanal or small-scale fishing gear, either from the shore or small boats. Fishing gear
includes sticks, spears, a variety of nets (mostly gillnets, trammel nets, beach seines and
encircling nets), handlines and longlines, and several types of traps (Fulanda et al., 2009;
Temple et al., 2018). There are also substantial numbers of gleaning harvesters, many of
whom are women, who collect invertebrates by hand in intertidal areas. Reported landings
since 2000 have doubled from around 0.6 million tonnes to 1.2 million tonnes in recent
years, largely driven by a steady increase in reported artisanal landings in Mozambique since
2006 (Mafuca et al., 2024).
2.4 Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) – Subareas 51.1–51.8
The area of competence for IOTC covers Areas 51 and 57 and adjacent seas north of the
Antarctic Convergence zone (FIGURE D.8.3). Essentially, IOTC is responsible for tuna and
tuna-like species (bonitos, billfishes, large
mackerels), and associated species (chapter
on tunas, PART E.1, GLOBAL TUNA FISHERIES,      FIGURE D.8.5
pp. 330). The main target is yellowfin          IOTC AREA OF COMPETENCE (BLUE), WITH FAO MAJOR

greater; swordfish (Xiphias gladius) and
bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) are also
highly sought-after, though the manage-
ment mandate covers a wide variety
(16 species) of tunas and tuna-like species.
Several distant-water fishing nations access
stocks by means of sophisticated vessels
with pelagic longlines and purse seines;
SWIOFC coastal states have limited
participation with these types of vessels,
but some countries make considerable
hook-and-line catches of smaller tunas
such as skipjack using smaller vessels. There
were 20 countries that reported industrial
sector catches in Area 51 to IOTC, and
26 reported artisanal-scale catches using
a wide variety of fishing gear. Not all
SWIOFC countries provide permission
to distant-water vessels for fishing in their
EEZs; permission is often via confiden-
tial licensing agreements that amount to
significant foreign exchange revenue for
some Area 51 countries. The tuna catch in

Western Indian Ocean




                             The SIOFA covers ABNJ resources including fish, molluscs, crustaceans and other seden-
                             tary species, but excludes highly migratory species and species subject to the jurisdiction of
                             coastal states (FIGURE D.8.4). The Agreement came into force in 2012, although substantial
                             catches were already being made in the early 2000s. Fishing gear used in these fisheries
                             includes bottom and midwater trawls, seines, gillnets and longlines. In deep water, trawlers
                             mainly catch splendid alfonsino (Beryx splendens) and orange roughy (Hoplostethus
                             atlanticus), as well as pelagic armourhead (Pentaceros richardsoni), bluenose warehou
                             (Hyperoglyphe antarctica), violet warehou (Schedophilus velaini), oreo dories (e.g. Neocyttus
                             rhomboidalis), black cardinal fish (Epigonus telescopus) and hapuku wreckfish (Polyprion
                             spp.). Lizardfish (Saurida spp.) and scads (Decapterus spp.) were targeted by smaller
                             trawlers on the Sayha de Malha Bank at one point. Longline catch composition varies
                             depending on area and includes Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) and asso-
                             ciated species such as blue antimora (Antimora rostrata), as well as oilfish (Lepidocybium
                             flavobrunneum, Ruvettus pretiosus), pelagic armourhead and, historically, deep-wa-
                             ter sharks, including Portuguese dogfish (Centroscymnus coelolepis) and kitefin sharks
                             (Dalatias licha). The catch of the historical gillnet fishery (now prohibited) was also
                             predominantly deep-water sharks. Seining targets mackerel (Scomber spp.) and bramids
                             (Brama spp.), while bottom longlines target ruby snapper (Etelis spp.) and other lutjanids.

3. RESOURCE STATUS
The updated methodology classifies stocks into tiers based on the availability and quality
of information for each stock (Tier 1, Tier 2 or Tier 3). Information on the status of
470 stocks was compiled for Area 51, representing a total of 284 species ( D.8.1).
   Of the stocks assessed, 153 are classified as Tier 1 (with formal assessments), 133 are
classified as Tier 2 (assessed with surplus-production model approaches), and 184 are
Tier 3 (assessed with data-poor approaches).
   The revised list of stocks and their respective status show that the majority of the stocks
analysed in Area 51 were found to be biologically sustainably exploited, with 40.9 percent
of the stocks estimated to be maximally sustainably fished and 22.1 percent underfished
(TABLE D.8.2). The proportion of stocks that were estimated to be overfished was 37.0 percent.
   The relatively high proportion of underfished stocks identified in this assessment
may be due to a recent spurt in assessments of fish stocks in the region (TABLED.8.1 and
APPENDIX II, TABLE 8 , pp. 436), with better resolution in species identification. In RECOFI
and SWIOFC countries, a large number of recent assessments have been made, using
data-deficient catch-only methods which are assumption-based and may have limitations
in reliability (Sharma et al., 2021).
   Additionally, the recent efforts made towards undertaking stock assessments in the
region has probably resulted in the addition of species of lesser importance in catches
than the main target stocks, that were often assessed as aggregates in previous years.
This potentially implies that at least some of these less important stocks may not be as
heavily exploited as the main targets which have been subjected to fishing pressure for
many years. However, some fish stocks in the RECOFI region are now subject to better
monitoring, assessment and management, which has contributed to the proportion of
underfished stocks.
    Overall, though, the current proportion of maximally sustainably fished and under-
fished stocks combined with the updated methodology in 2021 (63.0 percent) is almost
the same as the combined maximally sustainably fished and underfished stocks with the
previous methodology (around 62.5 percent). A considerable proportion of assessments
are Tier 3 (39 percent), owing to inadequate data availability, and consequently have
higher uncertainty over stock status.
   When weighted by landings, biologically sustainable stocks accounted for 70.6 percent
of assessed stocks monitored in 2021 (TABLE D.8.3).

                             4. KEY SELECTED SPECIES AND GROUPS
                             Tuna landings (dominated by skipjack tuna [Katsuwonus pelamis] and yellowfin tuna
                             [Thunnus albacares]) contribute most to landings and have increased steadily since the early
                             1980s (FIGURE D.8.5). There is still a high proportion of unidentified fish (around 50 percent of
                             all fishes including elasmobranchs), reported as marine fishes NEI (not elsewhere included),
                             which includes some jacks, crevalles NEI, clupeoids NEI, among others. Small pelagic fishes,
                             particularly Indian oil sardine (Sardinella longiceps), have long made a steady substantial
                             contribution; Bombay duck (Harpadon nehereus) predominates among the group of other
                             small pelagic fishes. Other (non-tuna) Scombridae (Indian mackerel [Rastrelliger kanagurta]
                             and narrow-barred Spanish mackerel [Scomberomorus commerson] predominating) have
                             remained stable since the early 1980s, while tunas and Carangidae (mainly jacks, crevalles
                             and carangids) have increased. Elasmobranchs, which are particularly poorly identified
                             (80 percent of landings are only identified to family or higher taxa), appear to be declining
                             in landings, while hairtails have made an increasing contribution since the mid-1990s.
                             Catfishes (Ariidae) have declined towards the end of the series, billfish and swordfish as a
                             group have remained steady, while there has been some increase in soles towards the 2020s.
                                After an increase in the relative contribution by invertebrates to catches from 2010 to
                             2019, there was a decline in the most recent year of the time series. Shrimp catches have
                             remained reasonably steady since the increase of the 1970s, while contributions by cepha-
                             lopods and other molluscs continue to increase. Crabs too have seen their catches increase
                             markedly since the mid-1990s. Contributions by other crustaceans and sea cucumbershave

declined since highs in the 1990–2010 period and the 1990s respectively. Lobsters have
more than quadrupled from 2009 to 2021.
4.1 Indian oil sardine
The Indian oil sardine is a major species in Area 51,and landings from commercial fish-
eries have been reported from six countries: India, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Oman,
Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen. In 2014, landings peaked at 632 000
tonnes, making it the fifth-largest sardinella fishery in the world. The maximum catch
recorded for Area 51 was in 2021 with 676 000 tonnes.
   In the Southeastern Arabian Sea (SEAS), the main area of their abundance, oil sardines
are fished by different combinations of crafts and gear, such as fishing boats with boats
with outboard engines using ring seines, gillnets, and seines, mechanized units using
ring seines and others. Oil sardine fisheries have existed for centuries in the SEAS, but
there have also been declines and collapses during the last century. Recent studies have
shown that this is associated with a combination of factors including rainfall variation,
overfishing and recruitment failure (Kripa et al., 2018). These observations indicate that
historic declines of oil sardines along the SEASa may also be related to ocean-atmospheric
processes, and these may occur at more frequent intervals in future due to climate change.
   The Indian oil sardine fishery is a significant contributor to India’s fisheries economy,
particularly in coastal states like Kerala, Karnataka and Goa (west coast). The fishery
provides livelihoods for thousands of fishers, fish processors and workers in related indus-
tries. A large portion of the Indian oil sardine catch is consumed domestically, especially in
southern India. A significant portion of the catch is used for fishmeal production, which
is an important ingredient in aquaculture feed. The recent surge in oil sardine landings
in RECOFI countries primarily supports the bait and fishmeal industry, with occasional
contributions to food demand in southern India.
4.2 Indian mackerel
Indian mackerel is a key species in the marine food chain and supports significant
commercial fisheries in these regions. Different types of seine nets (ring seines, purse
seines, beach seines etc.) are used to encircle schools of mackerel near the surface. Trawl
nets are also commonly used to capture Indian mackerel, especially in deep waters. In
addition, gillnets are used to target larger-sized mackerels. The average annual landing

                             of Indian mackerel in Area 51 over the period 1950–2021 was 101 000 tonnes, with peak
                             landings close to 300 000 tonnes in 1996.
Western Indian Ocean




                                Landings from the Indian west coast account for more than a third and up to half of the
                             Indian mackerel landings in the region. Interannual fluctuations in mackerel catches are
                             not as high as those of the Indian oil sardine. Mackerel’s reproductive strategy appears to be
                             quite distinct from that of oil sardine since it was found to have an extended spawning and
                             recruitment season from March to August and even extending to October along India’s west
                             coast (Krishnakumar et al., 2008). Therefore, the unfavourable environmental conditions
                             associated with intense upwelling may not affect the spawning and recruitment of mackerel
                             due to this reproductive strategy, which enables successful successful recruitment elsewhere
                             to make up for lost potential during the early upwelling season.
                             4.3 Bombay duck
                             The Bombay duck fishery is supported by a single species, Harpadon nehereus, and contrib-
                             utes a significant percentage of annual marine fish landings in India. With a peculiar
                             disjunct distribution of the species, the fishery is of particular importance in the two
                             maritime states of Gujarat and Maharashtra (northeast Arabian Sea), where over 98 percent
                             of the Bombay duck catch is landed. Bombay duck is caught in these two locations with
                             fixed bagnets (dolnets) which work with the tides. The highly restricted distribution of
                             the species is probably due to its preference for specific temperature and salinity regimes.
                                A recent assessment of the stocks of Bombay duck indicated that it is maximally sustainably
                             fished in Gujarat and underfished in the state of Maharashtra (Sathianandan et al., 2021). A
                             recent assessment indicated that a 1 percent increase in salinity (due e.g. to extreme climate
                             events) can reduce the MSY of the stock significantly (Kumar et al., 2023).
                             4.4 Hairtails, cutlass fishes, ribbonfishes
                             The Trichiuridae family, commonly known as cutlassfishes or ribbonfishes, is a diverse
                             group of marine fishes characterized by their elongated, ribbon-like bodies. These shoal-
                             ing and migratory fishes are found in oceans worldwide, inhabiting the water column
                             (midwater) in both shallow and deep waters. Trichiuridae have a unique shape, with a
                             long, slender body that tapers towards the tail. They have a large mouth with sharp teeth,
                             often extending beyond the jawbones. Their size varies widely, with some species reaching
                             lengths of over 2 m. They are carnivorous, feeding on a variety of prey including smaller
                             fish, squid and crustaceans, and serve as an important prey species for larger fish, including
                             tuna, marlin and sharks.
                                Many species of ribbonfishes form a major component of the fisheries in Area 51, espe-
                             cially in India, Pakistan and RECOFI countries. Ribbonfish landings in Area 51 show
                             wide variation, with an average of 75 300 tonnes and a peak of 264 500 tonnes in 2017.
                                Because of the excessive fishing pressure on ribbonfishes in India, the group has been
                             assessed as overfished in Gujarat and recovering in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala
                             (Kumar et al., 2023). Since the trawl is the main gear by which ribbonfishes are caught,
                             Sathianandan et al. (2021) advise a reduction in trawl fishing effort varying from 34 to
                             62 percent in different states of India.
                             4.5 Indian squid
                             The Indian squid (Uroteuthis [Photololigo] duvaucelii [Loliginidae]) constitutes an important
                             component of the inshore cephalopod fisheries in Area 51. It is one of the most important
                             cephalopod species exploited by the bottom trawl fleets in the eastern Arabian Sea border-
                             ing the west coast of India, though the precise magnitude of the large catch is uncertain
                             (approximately 100 000 tonnes). Typically, loliginids remain dispersed over the continental
                             shelf during the major part of their life cycle. Mature squids undertake spawning migrations
                             to inshore spawning grounds for congregation and egg laying, and commercial trawl and
                             artisanal fisheries take advantage of these aggregations (Sasikumar et al., 2018).
                                Currently, resource-specific management for Indian squid fisheries is limited to the
                             minimum legal landing size (Mohamed et al., 2014), apart from the seasonal fishery closure
                             during the monsoon. The species has been assessed as maximally sustainably fished in the
                             NEAS and the SEAS (CMFRI, 2023).

4.6 Prawns/shrimps
In this region, these are swimming crustaceans of the suborder Natantia, including
penaeids and carids. They are generally short-lived, fast-growing and with high fecundity;
species from shallow water (< 50 m). Those that probably make up the majority of landings
generally have an obligatory estuarine nursery phase. There are also deep-water (over 200
m) fisheries in several countries, targeting a different suite of natantians.
   Unfortunately, countries seldom report landings to levels below family. Landings
increased steadily until 1988 when they increased sharply, reaching a maximum in 2017
(349 900 tonnes). Thereafter there has been a general decline to levels last seen in the early
1990s, despite improvements in fishing technology in the industrial sector.
   For countries that have limited other sources of foreign income, exports can make a
valuable contribution to the economy. The industrial sector mainly uses trawlers with
varying levels of sophistication and with substantial levels of non-target bycatch; the small-
scale sector uses beach seines, drag nets, a variety of static nets and more basic trawlers.
   Despite the fast growth rates of prawns and shrimps, overexploitation is known to
occur, and – in the SWIOFC area at least – increased catches by the small-scale sector
have led to declines in industrial catches of shallow-water penaeids, likely as a result of
recruitment overfishing in coastal waters. User conflicts between the sectors have resulted
in spatial (inshore) area restrictions or multi-year moratoriums for industrial vessels, e.g.
in Kenya (Thoya et al., 2019) and Tanzania (Silas et al., 2023). A recent assessment indi-
cated that shallow-water penaeids from Mozambique are vulnerable to climate change
(Fennessy et al., 2024), and it is probable that such vulnerability exists in the wider
Western Indian Ocean where sea surface temperatures are increasing. There is increasing
mesoscale eddy activity in the Mozambique Channel, likely linked to climate change, and
these eddies have been shown to have a considerable influence on penaeid prawn larval
survival (Malauene et al., 2024), which could have severe implications for recruitment
of these resources in the Western Indian Ocean in future.

5. KEY FINDINGS
Area 51 is a large, highly biodiverse region encompassing over 32 countries/territories,
with two RFMOs and two regional fisheries commissions; a large part of the region is
beyond national jurisdiction. The region contributes about 7 percent of global production,
with catches increasing gradually since the 1980s and reaching a peak in 2019 (5.6 million
tonnes). There is marked regional disparity in fisheries production, with the northern part
of the Indian Ocean contributing disproportionately to the landings – this is linked to
the substantially higher oceanographic productivity in that region.
   Millions of coastal dwellers in the region depend on fisheries as a source of food.
Despite the effects of global warming, habitat degradation and the increased pressures
from rising coastal populations, overall landings are still increasing; a large proportion
of stocks are under pressure.
   Improvements to monitoring are constrained by financial and human capacity,
compounded by logistical difficulties in countries which have very long coastlines. A
consequence is that stock assessments in the SWIOFC in particular are not always avail-
able and are irregular. There are ongoing efforts promoted by the SWIOFC to undertake
weight-of-evidence assessments, including productivity and susceptibility assessments, for
several species in the region. India, which contributes more than a third of the landings
in the region, has recently carried out a considerable number of Tier 1 stock assessments
using biomass dynamic models (Sathianandan et al., 2021). However, several new Tier
3 assessments have recently been made with methodologies for data-poor fisheries with
high uncertainties (CMFRI, 2023).
   The proportion of overfished stocks – at 37.0 percent in 2021 – remains similar to the
results obtained with the previous methodology for the same year (TABLE D.8.4). The
number of Tier 3 assessments in non-SWIOFC countries/territories is higher than in
SWIOFC countries. One Area 51 region which shows a high proportion of overfished
stocks is the northern and eastern Arabian Sea.

                                The increase in the number of underfished stocks (22.1 percent in 2021 compared to
                             3.1 percent under the previous methodology) is due to a more than tenfold increase in
Western Indian Ocean




                             assessments (from 32 stocks in 2011 to 470 stocks in 2021), many of them at the level
                             of species using Tier 3 catch-only methods, rather than of species aggregates to genus
                             or above. This has resulted in the inclusion of species of lesser regional importance in
                             catches than the main targets. On the positive side, some stocks are better monitored and
                             managed, which has contributed to the increased proportion of underfished stocks; and
                             the overall proportion of sustainably fished stocks is substantial.
                                Moreover, maximally sustainably fished stocks – at 40.9 percent with the updated
                             methodology in 2021 – were lower than the 59.4 percent with the previous methodol-
                             ogy for the same year. Maximally sustainably fished stocks were less common in Tier 1
                             assessments than in Tiers 2 and 3. In addition, the coverage of 79.8 percent of landings
                             has remained relatively stable in comparison with 62.8 percent of landings assessed with
                             the previous methodology in 2021.
                                When weighted by production levels, biologically sustainable stocks account for
                             70.6 percent of the 2021 landings of assessed stocks monitored by FAO, a similar value
                             to the result obtained with the previous methodology (TABLE D.8.5).

  Area 51 is vast and biologically diverse, including over 30 countries/
   territories and supporting numerous fisheries.
  New collaborative methods of assessment and management, based on
   ecosystem principles, are being advanced in the region.
  Mangroves and other essential fish habitats that sustain extremely
   diverse small-scale fisheries are being threatened.
  The coastal regions of Area 51 are vulnerable to the impacts of climate
   change, including coral bleaching, sea level rise and extreme events.

1. OVERVIEW
The Eastern Indian Ocean, designated by FAO as Major Fishing Area 57 (hereafter,
Area 57), covers an area of 29.89 million km2 , including the Bay of Bengal in the north,
the Andaman Sea, the northern part of the Malacca Straits, and the waters around
western and southern Australia to the east. It covers the exclusive economic zones (EEZs)

                             by FAO Major Fishing Areas 58 and 51, respectively (FIGURE D.9.1). Area 57 follows the
Eastern Indian Ocean




                             southern coastlines of Indonesia and Timor-Leste as far as 129° east, bisecting Australia
                             at the boundary between the State of Western Australia and the Northern Territory, and
                             extending along the entire south coast of Australia (to a latitude of 55° south). There are
                             approximately 2.37 million km2 of shelf area in Area 57, which mostly coincides with
                             the Bay of Bengal. Narrower shelf areas are present on the western and southern sides of
                             Indonesia, Timor-Leste and Australia.
                                In the north of Area 57, the Bay of Bengal is located in the tropical monsoon belt and
                             experiences sea surface circulation reversal in the monsoon period with the Monsoon
                             Current (clockwise from January to July, counter-clockwise from August to December)
                             (Schott and McCreary Jr, 2001). The monsoonal systems mean this region is highly affected
                             by cyclones and storm surges. The primary productivity of the Bay of Bengal is considered
                             lower than that of the Arabian Sea, largely as a consequence of stronger stratification and
                             lack of upwelling (Prasanna Kumar et al., 2002). Nonetheless, seasonal upwellings on the
                             southeast coast of India and the east coast of Sri Lanka increase fishery productivity. In addi-
                             tion, areas adjacent to the major riverine outflows are provided with lowered salinities and
                             considerable nutrient and sediment loads to the shelves. These drive highly productive, but
                             relatively localized, shelf fisheries in the upper Bay of Bengal (the Ganges, Brahmaputra and
                             Meghna rivers) and Gulf of Martaban (the Ayeyarwady river). Even more localized effects
                             from smaller rivers in India also occur (the Mahanadi, Godavari, Krishna and Kaveri rivers).
                                Further south, the Indian Ocean shelves of Indonesia (Sumatra and Java) are relatively
                             narrow and steep, mostly with coralline and sandy bottoms and no major riverine input.
                             The south coast of Indonesia and the north coast of Australia are in the path of a low-sa-
                             linity warm-water current flowing west from the Pacific into the Indian Ocean called the
                             Indonesian Throughflow. While this current is relatively nutrient-poor, its interactions
                             contribute to the upwelling system along the southern coast of Java and Bali, making it a
                             driver of seasonal productivity surges (Koropitan and Osawa, 2021), particularly in coastal
                             zones. In spite of this, these waters are comparatively unproductive relative to the more
                             fertile Bay of Bengal region.
                                At the southern end of Area 57, the southward flow of the warm and low-nutrient
                             Leeuwin Current extends the range of the tropical fish fauna to waters west of Australia,
                             further south for this type of fauna than anywhere else in the world. However, this
                             current is also responsible for the low productivity of these waters. Along the southwest
                             and southern coasts of Australia, waters are temperate and the fish fauna is less diverse
                             compared to the northern region of Area 57. The oceanic regions of Area 57 are char-
                             acterized by low overall productivity except for higher primary productivity driven by
                             equatorial upwelling. This effect is more limited in Area 57 compared with the produc-
                             tive upwellings of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.
                                Area 57 is divided into six subareas, including one which is split in two other subar-
                             eas, reflecting its diverse characteristics and productivity. The main fisheries are pelagic
                             oceanic tuna fisheries and the more productive coastal shelf fisheries. The resources range
                             from the typical tropical species of the northern part of the Area changing to temperate
                             species in southern latitudes west and south of Australia. The large number of species and
                             aggregate groups reported for Area 57 is a reflection of the multispecies nature of most
                             fisheries in the region, particularly those in the tropical and subtropical areas. The main
                             groups that form the majority of the catch of Area 57 have not changed their order since
                             FAO’s previous Review of the state of world marine fishery resources (FAO, 2011).
                                Increased surface water temperatures and marine heatwaves, increased frequency or inten-
                             sity of storms and cyclones, ocean acidification and long-term sea-level change (rises in most
                             areas) – all made worse by climate change – are emerging concerns for Area 57. All of these
                             factors will affect fisheries to some degree, in terms of productivity, species distribution and
                             abundance, the ability of fishers to access resources, and the safety of fishing operations.

2. FISHERY PROFILES
Area 57 encompasses a diversity of climatic and oceanographic conditions, as well as
diverse types of fisheries, which can be separated into a northern region (Bay of Bengal
and the Indian Ocean shelves of Indonesia) and a southern region (covering western
and southern Australia, and adjacent oceanic waters). Landings harvested from Area 57
have displayed a consistent upward trend since records began, reaching over 7 million
tonnes in 2017, although they have subsequently declined to around 6 million tonnes
in recent years (FIGURE D.9.2). The total reported landings for Area 57 in 2021 were just
under 5.9 million tonnes. Over 99 percent of the catch of Area 57 in 2021 was reported
by coastal states, with non-coastal, distant-water fishing nations accounting for less than
0.5 percent (about 18 000 tonnes). Fishing capacity in Area 57 is high, with more than
520 000 vessels estimated to be operating in the Area. The majority of these are small
motorized or non-motorized vessels.
   It is not possible to accurately disaggregate the catch of Area 57 between large and
small-scale fisheries, with the exception of oceanic tuna resources. This is because almost
all demersal and small pelagic species are targeted by both segments of the fishing fleet,
but using different types of gear. Larger-scale vessels use trawls and seine gears, whereas
small-scale vessels typically use gillnets, traps, and hook-and-line gears. Based on national
reports (where available) and other sources,2 small-scale fisheries in Area 57 account for
43 percent of total landings (about 2.5 million tonnes), and large-scale fisheries account
for 57 percent of these (about 3.4 million tonnes). Thus, Area 57 (especially 57.1 and
57.2) has the greatest landings of small-scale fisheries , and some same stocks are targeted
by small-scale and large-scale fisheries. It is important that both segments be properly
addressed by fishery management. These figures are in general agreement with other recent
studies. FAO, Duke University and WorldFish (2023) found that small-scale fisheries
in Asia account for 37 percent of the catch and large-scale fisheries for 63 percent of the
catch. Another study for the entire Indian ocean (Zeller et al., 2023) concluded that large-
scale fishing contributed 57 to 60 percent of the catch in 2018 and that approximately
40 percent of total Indian Ocean catches originate from small-scale fisheries.
   The large concentration of fishing effort in Area 57, which commenced in the 1970s,
has resulted in overfishing and has had effects on fish stocks. Most notably, a shift in
the composition of catches over time has been observed towards more resilient, fast-
er-recruiting smaller species, along with a shift from demersal species to a mixture of
smaller demersals and small pelagics. This has been identified by national fishery research
programmes and fishery stakeholders and has spurred recent efforts by several fishery
agencies to improve the management of fishing capacity.
2.1 Northern region
The northern region of Area 57 encompasses the Bay of Bengal down to the Indian
Ocean waters around Indonesia (including coastal and adjacent oceanic waters), covering
subareas 57.1, 57.2 and 57.5.1. The majority of reported landings for Area 57 occur in
the northern region, with the Bay of Bengal alone representing over 70 percent of total
reported landings for Area 57 in 2021.
   Marine living resources are critical for livelihoods and nutrition in Area 57, and this
is especially the case in the northern region where most coastal countries have large
and growing populations. The coastal population around the Bay of Bengal is about
450 million, with fisheries employing some 4.5 million people, of whom 2.2 million are
fishers (BOBLME, 2012). The southern coastline provinces of Sumatra, Java, Bali and
West Timor employ a further 270 000–330 000 fishers (BOBLME, 2012). There are an
estimated 420 000 small vessels operating in Area 57, nearly all in the northern region
and most in the Bay of Bengal area, highlighting the importance of fishing for livelihoods.
Aquatic foods also represent a critical source of food, making a significant contribution
to animal proteins consumed by local populations; indeed, 76 percent of animal proteins

Eastern Indian Ocean




                             coastal states in India (BOBLME, 2012).
                                The catch in the northern region is largely composed of demersal species, with pelagic
                             species in coastal areas and exclusive economic zones (EEZs), as well as open ocean
                             resources. Fisheries in the northern region of Area 57 are predominantly coastal multi-spe-
                             cies and multi-gear, with a high concentration of fishing activity in the coastal area.
                                Demersal species are typically associated with shelf areas, with the main demersal fish shelf
                             fisheries located in the Bay of Bengal. These fisheries are largely correlated with the type of
                             bottom on which they occur; as such, on muddy-soft bottoms, sciaenids (drums) dominate
                             within a diverse and complex community including polynemids, sea catfishes, threadfin
                             bream, lizardfish, hairtails, various flatfish species and crustaceans. In less heavily-fished
                             shelf areas, snappers, butterfish and emperors are also important commercial species. Hilsa
                             shad (Tenualosa ilisha) are significant around the major rivers discharging into the northern
                             Bay of Bengal. The sandy shelf bottoms, such as in the Mergui Archipelago and along the
                             Thai coast of the Andaman Sea, are dominated by assemblages of slipmouths, goatfishes,
                             sciaenids and lizardfishes. Pelagic fisheries in coastal areas and within EEZs are dominated
                             by neritic tunas, scads, short mackerel, sardines and anchovies.
                                Catches of open ocean resources in Area 57 are dominated by tuna fisheries, mainly
                             skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis), along with yellowfin (Thunnus albacares), bigeye
                             (Thunnus obesus), albacore (Thunnus alalunga) and southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus
                             maccoyii). Historically, distant-water fleets from Japan, the Republic of Korea and Taiwan
                             Province of China accounted for a larger proportion of catches, peaking at 81 percent
                             in 1960. Following the expansion of the fleets of coastal countries in the Area in the
                             early 1990s, however, their catches substantially decreased and stocks are now primarily
                             exploited by coastal countries. In 2021, catches were dominated by Indonesia (62 percent),
                             Sri Lanka (12 percent) and India (9 percent). These coastal countries also target the neritic
                             tunas within their EEZs. Distant-water fishing nations now only account for less than
                             5 percent of the current catch of tunas, bonitos and billfish.
                                EEZ fisheries in this region are typically managed by a national fishery agency
                             (Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh), although in larger and federal
                             countries (India and Indonesia) fishery management is devolved to a state or provincial
                             government fishery agency, with common or shared stocks managed jointly with the
                             national or federal fishery agency. In cases where species are within the competence of
                             an international regional fisheries management organization (RFMO), the national fish-
                             ery agency cooperates in their management with the relevant RFMO – in Area 57, this is
                             mainly the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC). The IOTC is responsible for the
                             management of tuna and tuna-like species in the Indian Ocean (across FAO Areas 51
                             and 57), with its mandate covering 27 individual species which can be broadly divided
                             into large tunas, billfishes (swordfish, sailfish, marlins) and other tuna-like species (frigate
                             bullet tunas and neritic tunas), and pelagic sharks caught as bycatch within tuna fisheries.
                                The assessment of marine fishery resources may reflect a similar organizational arrange-
                             ment, but as capacity at the sub-national level may be limited, more typically assessments
                             are conducted by national fishery research agencies, who act as science providers to the
                             relevant management authority. Coastal states in the region have substantially improved
                             their fishery assessments in recent years, and these are now being used to inform fishery
                             policy and management decisions (SEAFDEC, 2024). The IOTC provides regular assess-
                             ments for the stocks within its competence (IOTC-SC26, 2023).
                                Two decades ago, fishing effort and capacity rose sharply in the northern region of
                             Area 57, with oceanic subareas seeing rising tuna catches, and other subareas witnessing
                             increased catches of other pelagic and demersal stocks. Declining catch per unit effort
                             (CPUE), changing catch compositions and declining profitability led to management
                             measures being put in place. In fisheries that have been subjected to high fishing pres-
                             sure for decades, increases in fishing efficiency and adoption of new technologies have
                             not been accompanied by an increase in biomass and catch (Sathianandan et al., 2021).
PART D.9 ■ Regional overview ■ Area 57: Eastern Indian Ocean                                      203



   Macro-scale spatial initiatives to control or partition fishing effort have been established
in many countries. These were primarily through zoning and exclusion arrangements for
coastal waters according to fishing gear or vessel capacity (India, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Thailand, Myanmar, Sri Lanka), although enforcement and compliance are challeng-
ing. Smaller-scale, localized spatial closures have also been implemented, associated with
marine conservation areas or for nursery or breeding areas (hilsa shad in Bangladesh,
lobster in Sri Lanka). Temporal closures are more broad-scale and have been enacted
across some fisheries (e.g. Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka), often coinciding with monsoon
storm season. The application of measures may be to segments of the fishery (e.g. larg-
er-scale commercial vessels), and where the measure impacts poorer fishers, there may be
some form of compensation for lost fishing opportunities. The effectiveness of all of these
measures has not been comprehensively assessed.
   Starting in 2007, Malaysia (Department of Fisheries Malaysia, 2015) and subsequently
Thailand in 2015 (DOF Thailand, 2015) implemented fleet and effort reduction plans
for various gear groups and segments of their fisheries to match the assessed maximum
sustainable yield (MSY) or multispecies MSY for the stocks they target. Indonesia is
currently establishing a similar plan (through the 2023 Measured Fishing Regulation) to
link vessel licensing to quotas based on estimates of maximum allowable catch for each
of the country’s fishery management areas.
   In spite of these management structures, the expansion of fleets and increased capacity
to access resources further from shore means that management capacity remains a chal-
lenge. Given that fisheries in the northern region of Area 57 are predominantly coastal
multi-species and multi-gear, with a high concentration of fishing activity in the coastal
area, controlling fishing effort is a persistent challenge. This is exacerbated where there
are a high number of small, medium- and large-scale vessels that must be managed and
whose catches need to be estimated.
   Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing has also become a concern, both
within the domestic fleets of or between neighbouring countries. Hotspots of IUU activ-
ity related to both forms have been identified in Area 57: they are typically located along
EEZ boundaries between countries and in high seas areas, and tend to be concentrated on
richer fishery resources (Wilcox et al., 2019). Recent efforts by coastal states have improved
the situation with regards to IUU fishing in Area 57. These improvements have notably
been driven by accession to the FAO Port State Measures Agreement (PSMA) and national
responses to trade pressures from market countries. As a result, countries have taken more
effective action, including implementing PSMA provisions, establishing equivalent national
regulations, and enhancing regional cooperation. Measures include suspending licences
for foreign vessels violating regulations, strengthening port controls, and upgrading vessel
licensing and registration systems. Monitoring has also improved through the creation of
vessel monitoring centres, widespread adoption of vessel monitoring systems (as required
by the IOTC for vessels over 24 m in length or operating on the high seas), tighter trans-
shipment controls, and increased use of catch documentation. There are also indications of
undeclared fishing in the Indian Ocean by long-distance fishing nations, as only nine out
of the 40 long-distance fishing nations that have flagged vessels identified as operating in
the Indian Ocean, report catches for Area 57 to FAO (Cappa et al., 2024).
   Climate change is also likely to impact several widely distributed species in the
northern region of Area 57. Small pelagic species – such as sardines, anchovies and
small mackerels – and species caught in the pelagic zone – neritic tunas, scads and
squids – are particularly sensitive to climate-related environmental changes (Fernandes,
2018). Important demersal species also likely to be affected are hilsa shad, Bombay
duck (Harpadon nehereus), and fourfinger threadfin (Eleutheronema tetradactylum)
(Fernandes, 2018). Given that many of these are key target species, this may pose a risk
for livelihoods.

                             2.2 Southern region
                             The southern region of Area 57 covers waters around western and southern Australia,
Eastern Indian Ocean




                             including areas of high seas. Australia is an urban coastal nation, and outside of its coastal
                             cities its western and southern coasts are very lightly populated; as such, fisheries play a
                             less important role in terms of livelihoods compared to the northern region of Area 57.
                             The total catch of the southern area is considerably less than in the northern region, with
                             Australian landings covering only about 1.7 percent of the total catch of Area 57. This
                             reflects both the very low productivity of these waters and the associated low numbers of
                             fishing vessels operating in the region.
                                Demersal catches in the shelf areas of the southern region are about 46 000 tonnes
                             (excluding sharks and rays) based on national reports. Clupeoids NEI (herrings, pilchards,
                             sardines and anchovies) form the largest volume of Australian catches in Area 57, repre-
                             senting 40 000 tonnes in 2021. Most of this catch is used as feed for tuna fattening (FAO,
                             2011). The tuna captured in the southern region of Area 57 (primarily subarea 57.4) are
                             mostly southern bluefin tuna, and the majority of Australia’s current catches (4 697 tonnes
                             in 2021) is value-added through cage fattening (Australian Fisheries Management
                             Authority, 2020). Hotspots for climate change have been identified off southeast and
                             southwest Australia and are predicted to expand and intensify. This is expected to have
                             impacts on species distribution and abundance, thereby impacting fisheries as well as
                             management by increasing uncertainty assessments (Butler et al., 2023).
                                In Australia, fishery management is devolved to states and territories, except for
                             common or shared stocks which are managed jointly with the relevant agency. In cases
                             where species are within the competence of an RFMO, the national fishery agency coop-
                             erates in their management with the relevant RFMO. Australia’s fishery management
                             approach is primarily based on maximum economic yield, which typically results in
                             catches below MSY. The outcome of this is that many (but not all) Australian fisheries
                             have relatively low fishing capacity and the effort is limited. There are few examples of
                             unsustainably fished stocks, and most overfished stocks are not directly targeted but are
                             incidental or bycatch species of other fisheries or are stocks that are yet to recover. Australia
                             has established some form of limited entry management for all of its commercial fisher-
                             ies, which are strongly linked to assessment findings, required under specific legislation
                             (e.g. environmental legislation and the 2007 Guidelines for the ecologically sustainable
                             management of fisheries).
                                Nonetheless, several challenges for fisheries management exist. For instance, in fisheries
                             where stocks are not overfished, but there are declining numbers of commercial vessels,
                             this can limit the availability of catch data to the point where robust indices of abundance
                             are difficult to maintain (Butler et al., 2023).

                             3. RESOURCE STATUS

                             3.1 Reference list of stocks
                             Previous FAO assessments of the status of stocks in Area 57 were based on 52 fish
                             stocks, most of them analysed using catch-only methods which are rated as Tier 3-type
                             assessments. To date, comprehensive stock status data has been scarce, with informa-
                             tion available primarily for selected coastal stocks in specific regions and only limited
                             assessments available based on catch records. The updated assessment process applied
                             in this report has significantly increased the number of stock assessments to 308 stocks,
                             representing a total of 197 species (TABLE D.9.1 and APPENDIX II, TABLE 9, pp. 447). The
                             total weight of assessed landings represented by these stocks is 3.64 million tonnes
                             (TABLE D.9.3). The large number of species and aggregate groups reported for Area 57 is
                             a reflection of the multi-species nature of most fisheries in the region, particularly those
                             in the tropical and subtropical areas. These aggregated groups have been assessed using
                             single species methods. It is worth noting that the catch of pelagic and demersal species
                             is nearly equal; given that just over half of the assessed stocks are demersal species, this
                             indicates a reasonably balanced coverage of the assessments. The proportion of demersal
                             species is higher for Tier 1 stocks.

3.2 CLASSIFICATION OF STOCKS
Across the 308 stocks assessed for Area 57, 27.3 percent were considered overfished,
49.4 percent maximally sustainably fished, and 23.4 percent underfished (TABLE D.9.2).
Of these stocks, 193 were classified as Tier 1 assessments, 96 as Tier 2, and 19 as Tier 3.
The largest share of sustainably fished stocks is represented within Tier 2, although the
difference between tiers is not significant. When weighted by landings, the portion of
sustainably fished stocks increases to 82.9 percent (TABLE D.9.3), indicating that the highly
abundant small-pelagic stocks, which dominate this region, are the most sustainable. Tier
2 stocks accounted for most of the more resilient species encountered in these areas, which
is also why the status is more optimistic than for Tier 1 where more vulnerable stocks
were assessed. Indeed, the assessed Tier 1 stocks were more evenly distributed across the
range of resilience which thus gives an indication of reduced sustainability compared to
Tier 2 stock. Moreover, most Tier 1 assessments have low uncertainty, while a majority of
Tier 2 assessments were considered to have medium uncertainty, with some high. Finally,
uncertainty for Tier 3 stocks was considered high.

                                         4. KEY SELECTED SPECIES AND GROUPS
                                         This section identifies the main species and groups targeted in Area 57 (FIGURE D.9.2). The
                                         top five major groups that form the majority of the catch of Area 57 have largely remained
                                         the same since FAO’s last review of the state of world marine fisheries resources (FAO,
                                         2011). However, although the largest contribution is still generically classified as “marine
                                         fish NEI”, its share has considerably reduced from its 34 percent in 2009 to 26 percent
                                         in 2021; as a result, there has been an increase in reporting for other groups which have
                                         increased their percentage share.
                                         4.1 Pelagic fisheries
                                         Pelagic fisheries in coastal areas and within EEZs are dominated by neritic tunas, scads,
                                         short mackerel, sardines and anchovies which together comprise 28 percent of the total
                                         catch in 2021. Specifically, miscellaneous pelagic fishes represented 18 percent of the catch,
                                         and small pelagic fish (herrings, sardines and anchovy) represented another 10 percent.
                                         These two groups form the first-largest group in terms of aggregate catch in Area 57.

PART D.9 ■ Regional overview ■ Area 57: Eastern Indian Ocean                                        207




The total catch of pelagic species (including pelagic sharks and rays) was approximately
2.3 million tonnes in 2021.
4.1.1 MISCELLANEOUS PELAGIC FISHES AND SMALL PELAGIC FISH
These species are primarily targeted in coastal fisheries, with small pelagic fish being espe-
cially vital in Area 57. Relevant stocks of small pelagic fish in Area 57 include sardinellas,
anchovies and Indian oil sardines (Sardinella longiceps). They provide a high-quality protein
source, support small-scale fisheries, and play a crucial ecosystem role as forage fish, connect-
ing plankton to larger predatory fish. While these species are found throughout Area 57,
most of the catch comes from the northern region (subareas 57.1 and 57.2). However, over-
fishing (particularly for scads) primarily occurs on some stocks in parts of the Bay of Bengal
and Indonesia. In addition, these stocks demonstrate marked inter-annual fluctuations in
catches that are driven by changes in environmental conditions and fishing pressure. This
makes it challenging to determine species’ stock status. Reported catches of both groups
have levelled off over the past five years. Nonetheless, miscellaneous pelagic fishes and small
pelagic fish remain quite resilient to fishing, and most are considered sustainably fished.
4.1.2 TUNAS, BONITOS AND BILLFISHES
The catches of open ocean resources in Area 57 are dominated by tuna fisheries. In 2021,
the tunas, bonitos and billfishes group accounted for 11 percent of the total catch in
Area 57, with catches having tracked those of the other pelagic groups, levelling off over
the past ten years. These fisheries occur in oceanic waters further out from the coast. The
large tuna fisheries represented 48 percent of this group, and are operated by longliners,
purse seiners and gillnetters. Catches are dominated by skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus
pelamis, at 186 414 tonnes), yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares, at 78 425 tonnes),
bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus, at 30 162 tonnes) and albacore tuna (Thunnus alalunga, at
13 686 tonnes). There are also smaller catches of southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii,
at 9 203 tonnes) taken in the more southern subareas. The status of these stocks is covered
in PART E.1, GLOBAL TUNA FISHERIES, pp. 330 of this report.
   Neritic tunas are caught closer to shore along the shelf by traditional, motorized and
mechanized fleets operating multiple gears such as seines, gillnets, hooks-and-lines
(longline, handline, pole and line) and even trawl. Neritic tunas represented 29 percent of
the catch in 2021. The seerfishes (including Atlantic Spanish [Scomberomorus maculatus],
narrow-barred Spanish [Scomberomorus commerson] and king mackerel [Scomberomorus
cavalla]) made up 18 percent of the catch of this group. Catches increased until the early
2010s and have been stable since then. Overall, these stocks are mostly sustainably fished,
with a few stocks overfished.
   Billfish (marlin, swordfish etc.) comprise 3 percent of the catch of this group and are
caught alongside tunas, mainly in the longline fishery. Their catches have declined from a
peak in 2004. Overall, two out of five of these stocks are overfished, with the rest sustain-
ably fished.
4.2 Demersal fisheries
Demersal species are typically associated with the shelf areas of Area 57, and comprised
34 percent of the total catch (2 million tonnes) for the Area in 2021.
4.2.1 MISCELLANEOUS COASTAL FISHES, MISCELLANEOUS DEMERSAL FISHES
The miscellaneous coastal fishes group, miscellaneous demersal fishes and flounders,
halibuts, and soles together comprise 16.4 percent of the total catch of Area 57. They
form an important part of the coastal fishery. After a continuous and steady rise, catches
have levelled off since 2015. The miscellaneous coastal fish aggregate includes many
resilient species that are an important component of trawl catches in the region (threadfin
breams, goatfish, silverbellies, lizardfish), but also less resilient species such as Bombay
duck (Harpadon nehereus), Arius spp. catfish, croakers, snappers and groupers. The more
vulnerable species tend to be in the overfished category, however there are also overfished
stocks of some more resilient species (threadfin bream, goatfish and lizardfish).

                             4.2.2 SQUIDS, CUTTLEFISHES, OCTOPUSES
Eastern Indian Ocean




                             Cephalopods formed 2 percent of the total catch in 2021, and they are dominated by
                             squid species. Cuttlefish and octopus are less significant components, although they have
                             a higher value. The assessments indicate that cephalopods are mixed overfished or maxi-
                             mally sustainably fished in subareas 57.1, 57.2 and underfished in subareas 57.5 and 57.6.
                             4.2.3 CRUSTACEANS
                             Marine crustaceans are another part of the demersal fishery and are dominated by shrimp
                             and prawns which made up 4.8 percent of landings in 2021. Crabs, sea spiders and other
                             miscellaneous species make up a further 2.5 percent. Many of the shrimp and prawn
                             stocks are overfished throughout 57.1 and 57.2. The crabs and sea spiders have more
                             underfished stocks, although they are overfished in some places. Lobsters, spiny lobsters
                             and rock lobsters form a small part of the catch and there are limited assessments which
                             indicate they are currently sustainably fished.
                             4.2.4 CLAMS, SCALLOPS, OYSTERS, BIVALVES, MOLLUSCS
                             Molluscan shellfish form a very small part of the catch of Area 57 (less than 0.7 percent
                             of the total) and there are very few stock assessments, but the six assessments available
                             indicate they are sustainably fished.
                             4.2.5 SHADS AND MISCELLANEOUS DIADROMOUS FISHES
                             Shads, diadromous and anadromous fish are all highly vulnerable to changes in the
                             brackish and freshwaters that they inhabit for part of their lifecycle. Disruptions to water
                             quality and flow (due to damming, stage and abstractions) and the installation of barriers
                             (e.g. saline barrages) all impact the ability of these species to successfully complete their
                             lifecycles in estuaries and rivers. The shads are dominated by catches of the iconic hilsa
                             shad (Tenualosa ilisha), which is a major fishery in Area 57 and comprised 5 percent of
                             the total catch of the Area in 2021. It is a staple in diets of people in the northern part
                             of the Bay of Bengal (particularly Bangladesh, Myanmar and West Bengal, India). The
                             status of these species is a combination of maximally sustainably fished and overfished.
                             4.2.6 ELASMOBRANCHS
                             The elasmobranchs include sharks, rays and chimeras, and formed 1.6 percent of total
                             identified landings in Area 57 in 2021. They can be split into two major groupings
                             according to where they are encountered, either as oceanic and pelagic species which are
                             usually caught as part of tuna and longline fisheries, or as demersal and coastal species
                             that are more typically encountered in trawl fisheries and some gillnet fisheries. Overall,
                             most species are considered sustainably fished. This result may be due to the inclusion
                             of the more resilient, smaller shark and ray species and assessments based on aggregate
                             groups. Individual less resilient species may be overfished in places, but the data is currently
                             lacking and as such was not included in this analysis.
                             4.3 Marine fish NEI
                             The aggregated and non-specific nature of marine fish NEI prevents any assessment
                             of status. This grouping represents 25 percent of total landings in Area 57 (just under
                             1.5 million tonnes), with the majority (58 percent, about 850 000 tonnes) being the
                             non-disaggregated catch of Myanmar. Forty percent come from Bangladesh, India,
                             Malaysia and Thailand. For the other reporting countries, this component is assumed
                             to be primarily the unidentified components and bycatch of trawl and seine fisheries
                             and the catch of multispecies coastal small-scale fisheries that are not disaggregated for
                             statistical purposes.
                                The unidentified species caught in the larger-scale trawl and seine fisheries typically
                             comprise juveniles of commercial species and low value species, and these landings are
                             typically utilized as fresh feeds or converted to fishmeal.
                                Case studies on the small-scale fisheries of the region indicate that the species groups
                             that dominate the small-scale fishery are primarily small and medium-sized pelagic species

and coastal demersal species (FAO, Duke University and WorldFish, 2023). These land-
ings are destined either for local processing and consumption, or more rarely as fresh feeds
for aquaculture or poultry.

5. KEY FINDINGS
Overall, landings of assessed stocks in Area 57 represented 67.6 percent of total landings
reported in the Area in 2021, an increase from the 46.8 percent that were covered by the
previous methodology. The status results obtained for Area 57 are largely in line with those
from the previous methodology in terms of the share of sustainable and unsustainable stocks,
with even an increase in the proportion assessed to be sustainable (TABLE D.9.4). In fact, results
from the updated methodology indicate a reduction in the proportion of maximally sustain-
ably fished and overfished stocks, and an increase in the proportion of underfished stocks.
This is because more resilient small pelagic stocks are being assessed compared to previous
analyses, a point reflected in results when stocks are weighted by landings (TABLE D.9.5). The
substantial increase in the number of stocks included in the analysis has not only improved
granularity in terms of species and groups, but also with regards to the assessments by
subarea. In addition, the use of the surplus-production analysis for Tier 2 stocks provided
improved fitting of models and reduced estimation uncertainty in the results.

                                In spite of this, the results also reflect a considerable difference in the scale of fisheries
Eastern Indian Ocean




                             and status of stocks among the subareas of Area 57. Indeed, the list of stocks compiled
                             includes a larger portion of stocks from subareas 57.1, 57.2 and 57.5.1; however, this is
                             representative of the fishing intensity and landings in Area 57, which are mainly concen-
                             trated in the northern region. It also aligns with the number of vessels of the coastal
                             states in these areas. Thus, the assessment results also highlight how catches of Area 57
                             are skewed to the subarea 57.1 (Bay of Bengal), relative to the lower catches in the rest of
                             Area 57. In Area 57, reporting of stock status by fishery subareas is better for indicating
                             where management is working and where it could be improved, due to the considerable
                             diversity of ecosystem contexts. Reporting the stock status of the region based on FAO
                             subareas would be more useful to the respective member countries, as these stocks are
                             under different forms of management and pressures.
                                This review has broadly split the fisheries of the region into pelagic and demersal
                             fisheries, and this reflects the different types of fishing operations and species targeted
                             by oceanic and shelf fisheries. It is worth noting that this analysis excluded the main
                             commercial stocks of tunas (albacore, bigeye, bluefin, skipjack and yellowfin; covered in
                             PART E.1, GLOBAL TUNA FISHERIES , pp. 330 of this document), although the neritic tunas,
                             large mackerels (e.g. Scomberomorus spp.) and billfish (swordfish, marlins) were included.
                                Importantly, the current reference list of stocks used for Tier 1 and Tier 2 assessments
                             reflects the current state of the commercial stocks which comprise the major fisheries
                             in Area 57. Given the high level of fishing effort, these stocks may disproportionately
                             represent species which are more resilient, with less resilient species no longer contribut-
                             ing significantly to the total catch. In addition, aggregation of species into larger groups
                             in Area 57 presented some challenges. Given that the data for more vulnerable stocks is
                             lacking, aggregating species could result in more resilient members of the group dominat-
                             ing the assessment. Both of these issues have the potential to present an overly optimistic
                             picture of the state of the stocks in Area 57. It is therefore important to ensure that more
                             vulnerable stocks continue to be increasingly included on the list of assessed stocks, even if
                             they do not form a substantial part of the catch. If not, results will continue to be skewed
                             towards the more resilient species.

  The region’s share of artisanal fleets is one of the largest in the world.
   Millions of people in this area depend on fisheries for livelihoods
   and food security.
  The increase in landings up to 2017 can be attributed to higher landings
   and improved data collection, while the recent decrease appears to be
   due to a reduction in fishing pressure.
  The small-scale and multispecies nature of the majority of the region’s
   fisheries, especially in the Bay of Bengal, poses challenges for both
   data collection and management systems.
  There is a growing social awareness, technological capacity and
   political will to manage fisheries sustainably.
  Fisheries in this region are important economically, nutritionally and
   culturally – but climate change poses a significant current and future risk.

1. OVERVIEW
The Northwest Pacific, designated by FAO as Major Fishing Area 61 (hereafter, Area 61),
includes major continental shelf regions such as the northern South China Sea, East China
Sea, Yellow Sea, Sea of Japan, and Sea of Okhotsk. Additionally, it includes smaller yet
productive shelf areas in regions like the western Bering Sea, the waters east of the Japanese

                          archipelago, the Kuril Islands, and the southeastern Kamchatka Peninsula. The total
                          area of the Northwest Pacific covers nearly 19 million km2 , including the third-largest
                          continental shelf, which measures approximately 3.6 million km2 (FAO 2005, 2011)
Northwest Pacific




                             This region includes the Yellow Sea Large Marine Ecosystem (YSLME). Primary produc-
                          tion in this ecosystem is strongly driven by multiple environmental dynamics (FIGURE D.10.2),
                          including the Yellow Sea Cold Water Mass, the Taiwan Warm Current and the Kuroshio
                          Current (also known as the Japanese Warm Current). The Yellow Sea Cold Water Mass
                          is a low-temperature, highly saline water body that resides in the central part of the deep
                          bottom layer of the Yellow Sea (Yellow Sea Trough); in summer it covers an area of about
                          130 000 km2. Cold-water masses are usually rich in nitrates and phosphates, which can
                          provide nutrients needed for the growth of plankton (Xing et al., 2024). The abundance
                          of plankton can provide food resources for fish and other high-trophic level aquatic organ-
                          isms, thus supporting a productive marine ecosystem. Cold-water masses in the Yellow Sea
                          mainly occur in summer, overlapping with peak spawning season for many economically
                          important fish species, particularly species with a preference for lower temperatures. The
                          Taiwan Warm Current is characterized by high temperatures and high salinity that flows
                          from south to north along the coasts of Fujian province (115°50´ to 120°40´ east, 23°30´ to
                          28°22´ north) and Zhejiang province (27°02´ to 31°11´ north, 118°01´ to 123°10´ east).

It brings a rich supply of nutrients and attracts a diverse assemblage of marine organisms.
The high temperature and salinity of the water brought by the warm currents provide ideal
conditions for the proliferation of heat- and salt-resistant marine organisms, contributing
greatly to the diversity of the fishing community in the East China Sea.
    The Kuroshio Current, also known as the Japanese Warm Current, is one of the four
major warm currents in the world and is a northern tributary of the North Equatorial
Current, originating in the eastern Philippine Sea and flowing into the East China Sea
via the northeastern island of Taiwan Province of China and the southwestern Ryukyu
Islands (Qu et al., 2016). Additionally, the Kuroshio flow process triggers surge currents
that assist fish migrations. The influence of the Yellow Sea Cold water mass on fisheries
is evident through the proliferation of the Zhoushan fishing grounds, the central Yellow
Sea fishing grounds and the Liaodong Bay shrimp farms; while the flow of the Kuroshio
Current has formed the East China Sea continental shelf fishing grounds, the Yellow
Sea–Bohai Sea fishing grounds and the Taiwan Strait fishing grounds.
    The major currents around the Korean Peninsula are the Tsushima Warm Current, the
Jeju Warm Current, the North Korea Cold Current, and the Chinese Coastal Current
(KHOA, 2024). The Tsushima Warm Current, a branch of the Kuroshio Current, flows
between the Republic of Korea and Japan toward the northeast. The Jeju Warm Current
flows clockwise around Jeju Island, the largest island in – and the southernmost land
of – the Republic of Korea. The North Korea Cold Current comes along the east coast
of the Korean Peninsula from the north, while the Chinese Coastal Current flows south
along the Yellow Sea. The annual average sea surface temperatures around the Korean
Peninsula measured by satellites from 2001 to 2023 ranged from 18.8 °C in 2011 to
19.8 °C in 2023 (NIFS, 2024).
    Starting in the 1950s, there was a steep upward trend in annual fishery yields in the
Northwest Pacific (Area 61), which reached 23.6 million tonnes in 1988 (FIGURE D.10.3). The
fishery yields fell from 1988, but then quickly increased again to about 23.7 million tonnes
by 1997. There has been a downward trend since 2014. In 2021, most of the catch was
landed by China (57.4 percent), followed by the Russian Federation (19.0 percent), Japan
(15.6 percent) and the Republic of Korea (5.1 percent) (FIGURE D.10.3). Catches by other
countries amounted to about 3 percent. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR)
was formally dissolved in December of 1991, and thus the Russian Federation’s fishery
yields have been reported since 1992 in the FAO database. Recently, there has been a
downward trend in fishing pressure in China, Japan and the Republic of Korea, which
may lead to an increase in the number of sustainable stocks in the future. In 2021, there
were nearly 448 000 active vessels in Area 61 and more than 2.5 million fishers.
    Numerous studies have shown that climate change has impacted seawater pH, nutri-
ent salt distribution, temperature, upper ocean currents, ocean density stratification, and
other key oceanographic processes in the Area (Xu et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024). These
environmental uncertainties can compound with fishing pressure and further affect the
spatiotemporal dynamics in fishery resources (Lu et al., 2024).
2. FISHERY PROFILES
2.1 China
Area 61 encompasses China’s four major seas: the Bohai Sea, the Yellow Sea, the East
China Sea and the South China Sea. China has a mainland coastline of 18 000 km and
an island coastline of 14 000 km (Qi, 2019; Zhao and Lin, 2016). The total sea area is
over 3 million km2 . China’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) supports some of the most
productive fisheries in the world. Fisheries in China’s EEZ employ a variety of fishing
gears such as bottom and mid-water trawls, stow nets, hooks and lines, surrounding nets
(seines) and gillnets.
   The Chinese Fishery Statistical Yearbook indicates that in 2022, China’s motorized
marine fishing vessels, specifically those engaged in China’s EEZ, totalled 130 000
(MARA, 2023). Small-scale fisheries account for a large proportion of China’s fishing
effort. However, fisheries landing data from China’s EEZ do not distinguish clearly
between industrial and small-scale fleets. Many fish stocks are subject to seasonal

                          migration, moving between inshore and offshore areas and along the coast. Some fish stocks
                          are distributed across different jurisdictional boundaries, subject to fishing in different
                          countries (e.g. Japan and the Republic of Korea), and are found in international waters
Northwest Pacific




                          which are subject to regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs) such as the
                          North Pacific Fisheries Commission (NPFC).
                             China is the most productive fishing country in the world. The total marine fishery
                          production of China was approximately 2.8 million tonnes in 1980, and by 1990 produc-
                          tion had grown to about 5.8 million tonnes, making it the largest in the world. Its fisheries
                          production exceeded 12 million tonnes for the first time in 1996, and reached a peak
                          of more than 13.4 million tonnes in 2015. However, growth then started to slow and
                          production has remained under 12 million tonnes since 2020. Recently, while contin-
                          uing to maintain the current levels of fishery production, the Chinese government has
                          placed greater emphasis on the sustainable use of fishery resources and alternative fishery
                          production methods, such as marine ranching and stock enhancement, rather than simply
                          pursuing an increase in the volume of wild fish caught.
                             The main species of economic value in marine capture fisheries in China are largehead
                          hairtail (Trichiurus lepturus), yellow croaker (Larimichthys polyactis) and Japanese Spanish
                          mackerel (Scomberomorus niphonius) (also known as Seerfishes NEI). Along with the rapid
                          growth of China’s economy and its fisheries industry, the number of people employed in
                          the sector has greatly increased since 1980, when it supported the livelihoods of more than
                          1 million people (MOA, 1980). In each subsequent year the number of people working
                          in the fishing industry rose, reaching 21 million people in 2004, then gradually declined,
                          stabilizing at 17 million by 2020 due to reduced production (MARA, 2021).
                             Since the People’s Republic of China was founded, the key goals of fishery policy have
                          been evolving in accordance with the needs of national economic development and the
                          condition of its fisheries. In recent years, China has gradually shifted from emphasizing
                          economic growth to focussing on ecological protection. Along with the global call-to-ac-
                          tion to protect the marine environment, fisheries resource conservation has become a top
                          priority of marine fisheries management in China. After the 13th Five-Year-Plan (2016–
                          2020) proposed updated double control targets and the first total yield limit, the Ministry
                          of Agriculture issued the Notice on Further Strengthening the Management of Domestic
                          Fishing Vessels and Implementing the System for Managing Total Marine Fisheries Resources
                          in February 2017, which outlined China’s central agenda for fisheries reforms. Soon after-
                          wards, the national government reauthorized the Provisions of Administration of Fishing
                          Licences, which entered into force on 1 January 2019; the Fisheries Law is currently being
                          revised to take more consideration of ecological conservation (Su et al., 2020).
                             To this day, the status of fisheries resources in China’s EEZ remains uncertain because of
                          limited fisheries catch and fishing effort data. In addition, the limited capacity for conduct-
                          ing formal stock assessments makes it difficult to regularly assess stock status. With the
                          acceleration of urbanization, some fishers have begun moving to cities to work in other
                          industries, forming a new livelihood pattern and leading to a decrease in the number of fish-
                          eries employees, which has also changed the traditional structure of the fisheries industry.
                          2.2 Japan
                          The main target species in Japan include small pelagic fish (e.g. sardine, anchovy, mackerel),
                          cod, squid, crabs, tunas, salmon and several groundfish (e.g. sea bream, flounder). The
                          revised Fisheries Act came into force in Japan in 2020, marking a significant reform in
                          the country’s fisheries management system. One of the key objectives of this reform is to
                          strengthen fisheries resource management. The 2020 revision emphasizes the implemen-
                          tation of a management reference point aimed at achieving maximum sustainable yield
                          (MSY). The goal is to maintain or restore fishery resources at sustainable levels. To achieve
                          this, total allowable catches (TACs) are set in a way that ensures fish stocks remain above
                          or can recover to MSY levels where they can be sustainably harvested.
                             Additionally, Japan launched a roadmap1 for promoting new resource management,
                          which focuses on several key initiatives to ensure the sustainable use of fisheries and other

                          1 https://abchan.fra.go.jp/about/
PART D.10 ■ Regional overview ■ Area 61: Northwest Pacific                                        219


marine resources. The roadmap includes enhancing stock assessments by expanding the
number of species evaluated based on the MSY, ensuring more accurate and science-based
resource management.
   The number of fishing vessels has been declining in Japan, with around 60 percent of
the boats being at least 20 years old. In Japan, the ageing of the population is a particular
concern for fishery workers, over 30 percent of whom are aged 65 or older (Delaney and
Yagi, 2017). Moreover, membership in fishery cooperative associations, which play a crucial
role in fisheries self-governance, has been declining (Delaney and Yagi, 2017).
   In stock assessments for each fish stock, the biological characteristics of the species are
thoroughly considered. This includes using population dynamics models that incorporate
age structure information to the extent possible. Such models are employed to estimate
resource levels, management reference points, and stock–recruitment relationships. For
that purpose, a “virtual population analysis” has been used as the main method. This is
a cohort-based analysis that reconstructs the historical population size of a fish stock by
analysing past catch data. It does not estimate the stock–recruitment relationship within
the model; the estimated recruitment and spawning stock biomass from the model are
used outside the population model to estimate the stock–recruitment relationship. In
cases where age-structured catch data is not available, other approaches such as statistical
catch-at-size and surplus production models can be used when catch data and biomass
indicators are available.
2.3 The Russian Federation
The majority of landings from the Russian Federation are reported to Area 61, with a
smaller amount in Area 67. The fisheries primary sector of the Russian Federation employs
over 67 000 people, and has an estimated fleet of more than 1 500 vessels. The Russian
Federation has a well-developed system of fisheries regulation based on scientific research
and consultations with fishing communities. Determination of TACs is regulated by the
Federal Law (2004), the Fishing Rules (2022) and the Order of the Federal Agency for
Fisheries, Rosrybolovstvo (2015), and based on regular research surveys.
   The Fishing Rules allocate areas of catch, fishing zones and subzones, set fishing periods,
and prohibit fishing in spawning areas, taking into account the biological characteristics
of a species that makes up a stock in a particular area. They also dictate prohibited areas for
fishing, minimal legal size, restrictions on the use of fishing gear, time limits, and consid-
eration of the interests of Indigenous Peoples. In accordance with this zoning, the state of
stocks is recorded and the TAC for fish stocks in a given area is determined.
   The precautionary principle, the ecosystem approach and the concept of MSY are used
to justify the TACs and the harvest control rules in accordance with the Federal Agency for
Fisheries, Rosrybolovstvo, for the sustainable development of domestic fisheries. Surveys
are carried out using bottom, mid-water and pelagic trawls, diving and acoustic methods.
Specialized crab and shrimp stock surveys using bottom traps are also carried out.
2.4 The Republic of Korea
Marine waters around the Republic of Korea, located around 37° north and 127° east,
belong to the temperate zone. The area of the Republic of Korea’s EEZ is 288 045 km2 , with
a continental shelf area of 68 902 km2 (MOLIT, 2024). Around the end of the twentieth
century, almost 300 different species of fish were caught by commercial fisheries in the
Republic of Korea’s EEZ (NFRDA, 1994, 2004).
   The country’s Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries uses the TAC policy as one of its key
fisheries management tools. As of 1 July 2024, it listed 16 species subject to TACs (MOF,
2024), and is considering adding more species in the future. The Republic of Korea’s
government has been attempting to reduce fishing pressure on domestic fisheries since the
mid-twentieth century due to conservation concerns, and in 2011 enacted a law to reduce
the number of fishing vessels (MOLEG, 2011).
2.5 Democratic People’s Republic of Korea
The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea was not considered in this analysis due to the
paucity of information about this region.

                          3. RESOURCE STATUS
                          The analysis for Area 61 was based on 92 stocks representing 51 species (TABLE D.10.1 and
Northwest Pacific




                          APPENDIX II, TABLE 10 , pp. 456). Of these, 56 stocks were classified as Tier 1 (with formal
                          assessments) and 36 stocks as Tier 2 (stocks assessed with surplus-production model
                          approaches). These stocks are considered to represent 63.4 percent of the total declared
                          landings for Area 61 in 2021. This is a large increase from the previous methodology,
                          which only comprised 25 species groups including multiple stocks of Alaska pollock
                          (Gadus chalcogrammus) and cod (Gadus macrocephalus), which represented 52.7 percent
                          of landings. However, assessments for some species have high uncertainty because of data
                          limitations.
                             In 2021, out of a total of 56 stocks assessed as Tier 1, 42.9 percent, 25.0 percent, and
                          32.1 percent were assessed to be overfished, maximally sustainably fished, and under-
                          fished, respectively. Out of a total of 36 stocks assessed as Tier 2 stocks, 27.8 percent,
                          41.7 percent, and 30.6 percent were considered to be overfished, maximally sustainably
                          fished, and underfished, respectively. Overall, 37.0 percent of stocks in Area 61 were
                          defined as unsustainable and 63.0 percent as sustainable (31.5 percent maximally sustain-
                          ably fished and 31.5 percent underfished) (TABLE D.10.2).

   Considering the amount of declared landings attributed to these stocks in 2021
(TABLE D.10.3), stocks classified as underfished comprise 30.5 percent of the total land-
ings accounted for by the assessed stocks, while those classified as maximally sustainably
fished account for 43.2 percent, and those classified as overfished account for 26.3 percent.
Accordingly, stocks classified as sustainable account for 73.7 percent of the landings, with
26.3 percent classified as unsustainable in 2021 when weighted by landings.

61                  222                                                       Review of the state of world marine fishery resources



                          4.1 Small pelagic fishes (anchovy, sardine, herring)
                          As in other FAO Areas, small pelagic fishes have contributed to considerable catches in
Northwest Pacific




                          Area 61. This group has comprised, on average, 13.7 percent of the total yield in Area 61
                          since 1950.
                             From the early 1990s, landings of Japanese anchovy (Engraulis japonicus) have been
                          primarily taken by China although landings by the Republic of Korea and Japan also
                          represent part of the catch. Total landings peaked at around 1.9 million tonnes in 1998
                          and have since decreased, with a harvest of just under 1 million tonnes in 2021 of which
                          around 600 000 tonnes were landed by China. Japan’s catches of Japanese anchovy have
                          mostly oscillated between 200 000 tonnes and 400 000 tonnes since 1950. They reached
                          a historical maximum in 2004 at 500 000 tonnes and have since steadily declined, reach-
                          ing a close to historical low of 120 000 tonnes in 2021. The Republic of Korea’s landings
                          of Japanese anchovy ranged from 54 000 tonnes to 293 000 tonnes between 1970 and
                          2021, with the average annual yield in the past ten years being 194 000 tonnes. There are
                          five stocks of Japanese anchovy whose status in 2021 varied from underfished to over-
                          fished, with the majority (four stocks) being sustainably fished (underfished or maximally
                          sustainably fished).
                             The catch of Japanese pilchard or Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) declined sharply
                          since the early 2000s. The catch has historically been and remains dominated by Japan,
                          whose catch represented around 640 000 tonnes in 2021. The combined landings of
                          most countries in the region (the Russian Federation, Japan and the Republic of Korea),
                          catches peaked at around 5 million tonnes in the 1990s, with a sharp decline since then.
                          The average catch 2017–2021 is approximately 100 000 tonnes for China. This fishery is
                          important for fishmeal and oil production. There are three stocks of Pacific sardine in the
                          region; two of them were estimated to be overfished and one of them underfished in 2021.
                             The overall catches of Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) averaged around 450 000 tonnes
                          over the last decade. They have historically been and continue to be largely dominated by
                          the Russian Federation (and previously the USSR), which accounted for approximately
                          410 000 tonnes of the catch in 2021. Japan and China were important players until the
                          1980s but the Russian Federation has taken most of the share of captures since the 1990s.
                          There are three stocks of Pacific herring in Area 61, with two maximally sustainably fished
                          and one underfished in 2021.
                          4.2 Largehead hairtail
                          The catch of largehead hairtail (Trichiurus lepturus) peaked at around 1.3 million tonnes
                          in 2006 and has been gradually declining since, amounting to about 910 000 tonnes
                          in 2021. Catches are mainly dominated by China since 1950, with largehead hairtail
                          representing a major commercial fish species in the country. China’s share of production
                          has ranged from 68 percent in 1983 and 96 percent in 2012. The Republic of Korea is
                          the second largest producer in the Area. From 1970 to 2021, the Republic of Korea’s
                          annual yield of largehead hairtail ranged 32 000–166 000 tonnes, averaging in the past
                          ten years at 48 000 tonnes. Fisheries from Japan and the Russian Federation also catch
                          these stocks, but in much smaller numbers (under 20 000 tonnes in 2021). There are two
                          stocks of largehead hairtail in Area 61, one is maximally sustainably fished and the other
                          is overfished.
                          4.3 Gazami crab
                          The fishery yield of gazami crab (Portunus trituberculatus) for Area 61 peaked in 2014
                          at 600 000 tonnes, gradually decreasing to about 476 000 tonnes in 2021. The aver-
                          age catch of gazami crab during the last five years (2017–2021) was 460 000 tonnes.
                          Widespread fishing of gazami crab in Area 61 started when China entered the market in
                          1987. Since then, landings have been dominated by China as it is a major commercial fish
                          in the country. The country’s share of production has ranged between 74 percent (1988)
                          and 98 percent (2004). Chinese production expanded until reaching a maximum of
                          580 000 tonnes in 2014 and has since declined, with 455 000 tonnes of landings in 2021.
                          The Republic of Korea’s annual landings of the species ranged 12 000–30 000 tonnes in
PART D.10 ■ Regional overview ■ Area 61: Northwest Pacific                                     223



the past ten years, amounting to about 19 700 tonnes in 2021. Japan has a small catch,
representing 1 793 tonnes of the catch in 2021. The two stocks of gazami crab in Area 61
are maximally sustainably fished in 2021.
4.4 Pacific chub mackerel
The fishery yield of Pacific chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus) in Area 61 has had fluc-
tuation of 0.5–1.5 million tonnes since the early 1960s, with the notable exception of a
historical high exceeding 2 million tonnes in the late 1970s. In 2021, landings were esti-
mated at 490 000 tonnes. Japan initially dominated landings, with a share of production
between 70 percent and 90 percent during the 1950s and 1960s. Since then, Japanese
catches have been declining and have converged with those of China. Both countries have
had a share of production of about 40 percent since the early 2000s. A small number of
catches are landed by the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation, and other countries.
There are three stocks of Pacific chub mackerel, two of which are considered overfished
with one stock maximally sustainably fished.
3.5 Seerfishes/Spanish mackerel/Japanese Spanish mackerel
Landings for this species group (Scomberomorus spp.) in area 61 increased exponentially
from negligible amounts in the early 1950s to a peak exceeding half a million tonnes at
the end of the 1990s. Since then they have remained between approximately 400 000
and 500 000 tonnes and amounted to about 415 000 tonnes in 2021. China entered the
market in the 1970s, during which its share of production in Area 61 revolved around
50 percent. This share steadily increased during the 1980s and 1990s to reach 90 percent
in the second half of the 1990s and has since remained close to these levels. In 2021,
Chinese landings of this species group in Area 61 represented about 380 000 tonnes. The
Republic of Korea and Japan also target this species group but to a lesser extent. There are
three stocks of Scomberomorus spp. in Area 61, whose respective statuses in 2021 were
underfished, maximally sustainably fished, and overfished.
3.6 Yellow croaker
The yellow croaker (Larimichthys polyactis) fishery in Area 61 was initially dominated
by Japan during the 1950s and 1960s. Overall catches for the Area fluctuated around
100 000 tonnes per year during that period. Between 1970 and 1990 catches for the
area fell to about 50 000 tonnes per year, with China and the Republic of Korea sharing
these landings amid a decline in Japanese catches. Since the 1990s, catches of yellow
croaker in Area 61 increased dramatically, reaching a maximum of 460 000 tonnes in
2011 and subsequently declining, with 2021 catches at 320 000 tonnes. The Chinese
share of production has remained close to 90 percent since the mid 1990s. There are two
stocks of yellow croaker in Area 61; one is considered maximally sustainably fished and
the other overfished.
4.7 Japanese jack mackerel
The Japanese jack mackerel (Trachurus japonicus) catch in Area 61 was historically domi-
nated by Japan, which represented over 90 percent of the share of landings during the
second half of the twentieth century. Its catches multiplied by a factor of close to 10
during the 1950s, remained around half a million tonnes during the first part of the
1960s and dropped back to about 60 000 tonnes by 1980. A second period of growth
brought Japanese landings to about 300 000 tonnes per year in the mid-1990s. Since
then, the share of Japanese landings has been declining and were close to 90 000 tonnes
in 2021, corresponding to a Japanese share of catches of about 50 percent. In parallel,
China’s fishery for Japanese jack mackerel largely began in the early 2000s, with catches
peaking at 190 000 tonnes in 2007, and gradually declining to 28 000 tonnes in 2021. The
Republic of Korea’s fishery yield of Japanese jack mackerel from 1970 to 2023 ranged from
565 tonnes in 1980 to 49 600 tonnes in 2021 with an annual average of 20 400 tonnes.
Overall, the stocks of Japanese jack mackerel are considered overfished, with one maxi-
mally sustainably fished.

                          4.8 Alaska pollock
                          The Alaska pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) stocks in the North Pacific are amongst the
Northwest Pacific




                          largest stocks globally. Landings peaked at around 5 million tonnes in 1985, and recently
                          have been relatively stable at about 2 million tonnes. Japan, China and the Russian
                          Federation fish on different components of these stocks. However, the largest and most
                          productive stocks are in the waters targeted by the Russian Federation. The precautionary
                          principle and the ecosystem approach are used to estimate the TAC and support the
                          sustainable development of domestic fisheries. Surveys are carried out using bottom,
                          mid-water and pelagic trawls, mid-water and pelagic trawls, acoustic and Ichthyoplankton
                          methods; these inform the harvest control rule along with the fishery-dependent catch
                          per unit effort (CPUE). Historically, Japan and to a lesser extent the Republic of Korea
                          landed a larger portion of the stocks than at present. However, since the early 1990ss the
                          share of landings of Alaska pollock from these countries has remained relatively stable
                          at around 13 percent and 4 percent, respectively. Overall, most of the stocks of Alaska
                          pollock in Area 61 are considered sustainably fished, with the exception of two that are
                          considered overfished.
                          4.9 Pacific cod
                          Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) is one the most important species in Area 61 after Alaska
                          pollock. Landings of this species have range of 130 000–230 000 tonnes in the last ten years.
                          The stocks are primarily targeted by the Russian Federation followed by Japan, and to a lesser
                          extent the Republic of Korea. The landings of Japanese fleets have remained relatively stable
                          since the late 1950s at around 51 000 tonnes per year, although with some peaks and dips.
                          Production of Pacific cod by the Russian Federation (previously the USSR) grew exponen-
                          tially in the early 1980s, peaking at just over 188 000 tonnes in 1985. In 2021, the Russian
                          Federation landed just under 164 000 tonnes of Pacific cod, representing about 71 percent
                          of the total landings of Pacific cod for Area 61. Overall, of the seven stocks of Pacific cod in
                          Area 61, most are sustainably fished, with only one stock considered overfished.

                          5. KEY FINDINGS
                          This report found that, in 2021, 37.0 percent of assessed stocks in Area 61 were over-
                          fished, 31.5 percent were maximally sustainably fished, and 31.5 percent were underfished.
                          Compared with the previous assessment in 2021, where 56 percent were assessed as over-
                          fished, 24.0 percent as maximally sustainably fished, and 20.0 percent as underfished, these
                          new results indicate that the overall stock status is better than had previously been estimated
                          (TABLE D.10.4). This is due to a number of reasons, including that the updated assessment has a
                          higher resolution with 92 stocks in the reference list, while the previous assessment was based
                          on 25 aggregated stocks. New unique stocks were added from China, the Republic of Korea
                          and the Russian Federation that were not previously analysed. In addition, the improvement
                          in the updated assessment results can also partly be attributed to the reduction in fishing
                          pressure, as fishing efforts in China, Japan and the Republic of Korea have decreased during
                          the last decade. As such, stocks may be on a rebuilding trajectory in the region. Moreover,
                          in the North Pacific waters of the Russian Federation, management procedures are in effect
                          that aim to ensure the long-term sustainability of the stocks.
                             Despite the increase in the number of assessed stocks, an estimated 37 percent of land-
                          ings remain from unassessed stocks. Better data and information for some assessments
                          could reduce uncertainty as well as improve coverage for the region. In addition, the
                          stock structure of different species is poorly understood as multiple sub-stocks may exist
                          in the region. For example, there is a need to examine whether or not the same species of
                          Japanese flying squid (Todarodes pacificus) harvested in in waters of the Republic of Korea
                          and Japan should be considered a single stock unit for assessment purposes.
                             When weighted by the volume of landings, biologically sustainable stocks accounted
                          for 73.7 percent of the reported landings of assessed stocks monitored by the FAO in
                          2021 (TABLE D.10.5), a significant improvement over the previous methodology, which
                          estimated only 52.8 percent from sustainable stocks in 2021.

   The stock assessment results are highly sensitive to assumptions about stock structure
and species distribution, which can vary drastically in this region under ocean changes
influenced by climate. In regions where spatial distributions of marine fishes are affected
by ocean conditions, changes in composition and abundance of fish species and popu-
lations are frequent – stock structures can be dynamic. In Areas where the impacts of
rapid climate change are evident, it is important to carefully track and examine further
variations in patterns of species abundance.

 KEY MESSAGES                                                                                                                            ESTIMATED LANDINGS (MILLION TONNES) FOR REGIONS BORDERING THIS AREA FAO data, 1950–2021

  The Northwest Pacific region is one of the most productive fishing areas
   in the world, supplying around a quarter of global landings.
  In this Area, concerted efforts have been taken to reduce fishing
   pressure by reducing effort and access to fishing grounds.
  Landings of squid, cuttlefish, octopus and shrimp have increased greatly
   since 1990, while landings of key fish species such as Japanese pilchard,
   Japanese anchovy and Alaska pollock have declined, partially due to
   overfishing and declines in recruitment.
  Climate change may increase the intensity and size of storms in the North
   Pacific and impact the distributional ranges of marine resources, fish
   sizes and stock abundances.

1. OVERVIEW
The Northeast Pacific, designated by FAO as Major Fishing Area 67 (hereafter, Area 67),
is bounded to the north and east by the United States of America (hereafter, United
States) and Canada, and in the northwest by the Russian Federation (the eastern Gulf
of Anadyr). It encompasses the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of the United States,
Canada and the Russian Federation, as well as adjacent high seas. Area 67 extends from
Alaska in the north, through British Columbia, Washington and Oregon, to California
in the south. The southern limit of Area 67 is located in northern California, at the border
with Area 77. Area 67 covers a total surface area of about 8 million km2 (FIGURE D.11.1), of
which 1.3 million km2 is shelf area. A large part of the coastal range and shelf are located in
the marine waters of Alaska, with a much narrower continental shelf in British Columbia.

                             The Area is characterized by distinct large marine ecosystems, including the California
                          Current, the Gulf of Alaska and the East Bering Sea. The California Current moves south
Northeast Pacific




                          carrying cold water from southern British Columbia along the western coast of North
                          America, and spirals around at the southern Baja California Sur to meet the equator.
                          The eastern part of the North Pacific Gyre, a Pacific-wide swirling current that stretches
                          across the northern half of the Pacific, creates upwellings off the California coast bring-
                          ing up cooler, nutrient-rich waters that support significant fish resources. This movement
                          of cooler water creates a cooler climate on the west coast compared to the eastern side of
                          the United States where ocean currents move up from the warm Caribbean and tropical
                          Atlantic.
                             Area 67 has a long history of fisheries, with Indigenous populations having harvested
                          marine resources in the region for millennia for nutrition, livelihoods and culture (Cox et
                          al., 2024). The importance of marine resources has been promoted through Indigenous
                          artwork, ritual, cosmologies and storytelling in the region, and continues to represent
                          a source of pride and identity. Marine resource management is a longstanding practice
                          of Indigenous populations in Area 67, with approaches rooted in co-existence, building
                          with, and enabling the mutual flourishing of habitats and their inhabitants. Given the
                          historical importance of Indigenous fisheries, there is increased interest in incorporating
                          traditional knowledge and management systems into modern management frameworks
                          to make them more sustainable and equitable (Reid et al., 2021).
                             Industrial fishing began in the 1960s with respect of demersal species off the coast of
                          the United States and Canada with primarily foreign fleets targeting stocks in the Area.
                          However, with the declaration of EEZs in 1982 – whereby around 40 percent of marine
                          waters were placed within the waters of the United States and Canada – these fisheries
                          sharply declined, transitioning through joint ventures to almost entirely domestic oper-
                          ations (Iriondo et al., 2019). Today, the vast majority of catches are taken by the United
                          States, with a smaller but significant contribution by Canada; Russian Federation fisheries
                          are minor, covering only a small area. Recreational fishing has also grown substantially
                          and contributes to the tourism and leisure economy both in coastal and inland areas.
                             Although species and fisheries in this region are diverse, landings are dominated by
                          the Alaska pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus, also known as walleye pollock), which forms
                          the largest catch of a single species in Area 67 at 50.6 percent of total landings in 2021.
                          The North Pacific hake (Merluccius productus) is also an important fishery, represent-
                          ing the most abundant commercial fish species in the California Current Large Marine
                          Ecosystem and an important part of the ecosystem as both predator and prey (Hamel et
                          al., 2015). Other primary fisheries that are targeted in Area 67 include Pacific cod (Gadus
                          macrocephalus), Dungeness crab (Metacarcinus magister), sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria)
                          and Pacific salmons (Oncorhynchus spp.).
                             Since the early twentieth century, industrial trawl fisheries have been the dominant fish-
                          ing gear used for both open water and demersal fisheries in Area 67, although many areas
                          remain closed to demersal trawl fishing due to gear conflicts and sensitive habitats (e.g.
                          rocky areas, corals, anemones, kelp beds). Technological improvements such as advanced
                          gear and fish-finding technology have made commercial fisheries increasingly efficient. To
                          manage these advances and address environmental and overfishing concerns, laws have
                          been enacted to establish fishing seasons, size limits and catch quotas. In addition, regu-
                          lations to minimize bycatch and reduce the impact of fishing gear on non-target species
                          and habitats (e.g. the seafloor) have been developed.

2. FISHERY PROFILES
The fisheries in Area 67 cover multiple jurisdictions: three national jurisdictions (the
United States, Canada and the Russian Federation) and the high seas. Over the years,
total marine captures in Area 67 have increased from an average of around 600 000 tonnes
per year in the 1950s to around 2–3.5 million tonnes per year between 1970 and 2021
(FIGURE D.11.2). The subsections below focus on the fisheries profiles of the United States
and Canada, as these represent the large majority of catches in the Area. Landings from
the Russian Federation for Area 67 only represent about 5 000 tonnes per year, and are
largely pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus).
2.1 United States of America
The fisheries of the United States in Area 67 are managed by the North Pacific Fishery
Management Council, covering Alaskan fisheries, and the Pacific Fishery Management
Council, covering fisheries in Washington, Oregon and California, both established under
the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (1976) (NOAA,
2022). Each major fishery is required to have a fishery management plan which documents
its harvest strategy; these plans are maintained by the Councils and amended regularly.
Special provisions are also provided to Indigenous fisheries, including the protection of
traditionally-fished areas and efforts to maintain or develop Indigenous fishing activities.
Treaties are also established between Indigenous groups to co-manage the populations
and uphold treaty-reserved fishing rights.
   The Alaska pollock is the primary fishery of the United States in Area 67, and is caught
by domestic pelagic trawls targeting fish aggregations. Catches peaked at over 1.5 million
tonnes in 2005 and have generally been maintained at around 1.2 million tonnes since
the late 1980s. Alaska pollock is managed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) Fisheries and the North Pacific Fishery Management Council,
and specifically under the 1982 Groundfish Fishery Management Plans for the Gulf of
Alaska and the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands. Management measures are based on
an integrated assessment that sets total allowable catch (TAC) levels using an agreed
management procedure; these are updated on a yearly basis. Management procedures for
the Alaska pollock fisheries have been established relating to mesh size and prohibitions
on the capture of certain species, such as snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) and king crabs
(Lithodes spp.).
   Demersal fisheries are also significant, and are among the most economically impor-
tant fisheries in Area 67, encompassing a large number of species and stocks. Pacific cod
(Gadus macrocephalus) and yellowfin sole (Limanda aspera) form the highest proportion
of the landed demersal catch, followed by Atka mackerel (Pleurogrammus monopterygius),
Pacific ocean perch (Sebastes alutus), rock sole (Lepidopsetta bilineata), and arrowtooth
flounder (Atheresthes stomias). Although trawling (specifically with otter trawls) is the
prevalent gear in terms of landings, pots (traps), longlines, hook-and-line (mobile or
fixed) and set nets (gillnets and trammel nets) are also permitted to catch groundfish.
The different fishing vulnerabilities of demersal species, coupled with the mixed nature
of the catch, make the demersal fishery difficult to manage. The health of any one of these
stocks can limit fishing opportunities for the others.
   The United States manages demersal fisheries through the 1982 Pacific Groundfish
Fishery Management Plan. Specifically, the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management
Plan (FMP) covers demersal fisheries from Washington to California, and Alaskan demer-
sal fisheries are managed under two separate plans: one for the Gulf of Alaska and the
other for the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands. Improved management has shifted the
demersal fishery from having high discard rates and overcapacity, to a profitable fishery
using a catch share programme, reducing fishing capacity and rebuilding fish stocks. The
limited-entry shore-based groundfish trawl fishery has several gear requirements and
prohibitions that support minimizing the impact of gear on non-target species and habi-
tats within the fishery. In addition, an active research plan conducts routine fish surveys to

                          provide indices of abundance for species, as well as information on the environment and
                          other factors that affect fish populations (NOAA Fisheries, 2023). Indigenous demersal
Northeast Pacific




                          fisheries also have specific management; for instance, the Makah tribe has a designated
                          “Usual and Accustomed” area set aside for its groundfish fishing which protects tradi-
                          tional rights of access (Wilson et al., 2024). The Makah fishery operates within the wider
                          harvest strategy but the tribe monitors and enforces relevant regulations within this area.
                              The North Pacific hake (Merluccius productus, or Pacific whiting) is another important
                          fishery, with coast-wide landings averaging 237 000 tonnes per year between 2010 and
                          2021. It is targeted using midwater trawls, although it is also caught in demersal trawls
                          as part of the groundfish catch. Stocks of coastal North Pacific hake are managed under
                          a bilateral treaty between the United States and Canada (Pacific Hake/Whiting Treaty,
                          2003), which includes a default harvest policy, fixed harvest allocations by country, and
                          a joint management committee. Joint stock assessments, acoustic surveys and manage-
                          ment meetings are also undertaken. The treaty grants 73.88 percent of the overall TAC
                          to the United States and 26.12 percent to Canada, with specific allocations provided
                          to Indigenous Peoples. Although catches of North Pacific hake are large, fleets from
                          the United States only harvested 65 percent of their quota, while Canada harvested
                          27 percent, in the 2021–2023 period.
                              Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) is caught in commercial, recreational and
                          subsistence fisheries. Although most of the fishery and stock is found in Alaskan waters,
                          this fishery is jointly managed by the United States and Canada through the International
                          Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC, established in 1923). It sets catch limits for each
                          country, dates for the closed season during spawning, and a minimum size to protect
                          juveniles. These regulations are established and enforced by each country’s fishery manage-
                          ment systems. In both countries, some catch quota for halibut is allocated to eligible
                          coastal communities for Indigenous and recreational fishing to support employment and
                          socioeconomic development.
                              Salmon fishing has a long and important cultural and economic history in Area 67,
                          both for Indigenous and commercial fisheries, the latter of which began in the 1800s.
                          Pacific salmon includes several species (e.g. Chinook [Oncorhynchus tshawytscha], chum
                          [Oncorhynchus keta], coho [Oncorhynchus kisutch], sockeye [Oncorhynchus nerka] and
                          pink [Oncorhynchus gorbuscha] salmon), of which many are targeted by commercial
                          fisheries. Salmon fisheries are primarily managed through state and indigenous tribal
                          organizations. In addition, a a dedicated regional fisheries management organization
                          (RFMO)–the Pacific Salmon Commission–which covers the allocation and catches in
                          preterminal ocean salmon fisheries shared by the United States and Canada. They also
                          look after the fisheries management of the Fraser river sockeye. In the United States, the
                          Pacific Fishery Management Council and the Pacific Salmon Commission work with
                          NOAA to manage harvesting of salmon in Area 67. Management plans include licens-
                          ing and quotas to limit mortality in rivers and at sea, the development of hatcheries, and
                          habitat restoration and protection (NOAA Fisheries, 2024).
                              The main trap fisheries for the United States in Area 67 are for Dungeness crab
                          (Metacarcinus magister), spot shrimp (Pandalus platyceros), Mexican spiny lobster
                          (Panulirus interruptus) and sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria). The Dungeness crab fishery
                          is the largest by far and represents one of the most important seafood industries in North
                          America, ranking sixth in value among United States commercial fisheries in 2016 at USD
                          222.6 million ( NOAA, 2018). There is no coast-wide management for Dungeness crab;
                          instead, it is managed at state level by respective Fish and Wildlife Agencies, who consult
                          through a Tri-state Dungeness Crab Committee. Key management measures include
                          licences (for commercial and recreational fishing), trap and pot limits, male and hard shell
                          only take, and seasonal closures. Fisheries have been closed in some states due to a popu-
                          lation decrease caused by predation, environmental changes and other unknown causes.

2.2 Canada
Fisheries along the coast of British Columbia – the region of Canada included in Area
67 – have a long history of Indigenous and commercial fisheries, the latter of which began
in the mid-twentieth century. Fisheries in Canada are primarily managed through the
Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO), with engagement from some
other authorities such as Indigenous communities. The participation of Indigenous
communities in fisheries (both traditional and commercial) is managed by each province
or territory. Moreover, the Fisheries Resources Reconciliation Agreement (2021) was
established between eight First Nations of British Columbia and the Government of
Canada to promote Indigenous fishing rights, access to fisheries and the marine econ-
omy, and increased involvement in policy and decision-making through community
management.
   The primary fisheries targeted by Canadian domestic fleets in Area 67 are the North
Pacific hake, Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii), rockfish, salmon and Dungeness crab fish-
eries, and to a lesser extent flatfishes and Alaska pollock. Fisheries operations are similar
to those of the United States in Area 67, but are usually smaller in scale. For example,
Canadian Pacific hake fishery vessels almost exclusively deliver to shore-based processors
rather than processing at sea.
   Modern industrial fisheries (gillnet, purse seine and troll) developed in British
Columbia from the late 1890s with the arrival of canning, through to the 1960s and
were dominated by catches of Pacific herring and salmon. A subsequent decline until
1980 was largely driven by a sharp drop in Pacific herring catches (Castañeda et al., 2020).
Although the diversity of overall landings then increased again with the development of
the North Pacific hake fishery, a general decline in commercial fisheries has nonetheless
occurred since the early 1990s. Demersal trawl catches include flatfish, skates and rock-
fish (canary [Sebastes pinniger], quillback [Sebastes maliger], widow [Sebastes entomelas],
yelloweye [Sebastes ruberrimus], yellowmouth [Sebastes reedi] and yellowtail rockfish
[Sebastes flavidus]), similar to adjoining United States fisheries. Today, annual landings
average 150 000–200 000 tonnes per year. Some species are also targeted by Indigenous
fisheries; for instance, Pacific halibut is caught by First Nation communities in ceremo-
nial and subsistence fisheries.
   Commercial fishing for Pacific salmon in Canada has existed since the late 1890s
(Castañeda et al., 2020), with current harvests focused on sockeye, chum and pink
salmon, with only a small percentage of the catch represented by Chinook and coho
salmon. The typical commercial gears are gillnets and purse seine. The salmon fishery
in Area 67 is managed by the federal government and was open-entry until 1975, when
limited-entry licensing was introduced. Elsewhere along the West Coast and Alaska,
the commercial catches of Chinook and Coho salmon have declined in the last decade.
However, Sockeye, Pink and Chum salmon have remained stable. Indigenous fisheries
are an important component when managing these stocks. These fisheries are both tradi-
tional and commercial, and are an important economic resource for many Indigenous
Peoples along the entire west coast of North America.
   The British Columbia Dungeness crab fishery uses traps. It is organized into seven
management areas in British Columbia, with management overseen by the DFO. The
management approach is very similar to that of the United States, with minimum size,
male and hard shell only take, and a seasonal closure. The British Columbia Dungeness
crab fishery also has a stock assessment programme based on fishery-independent survey
data conducted by the DFO. It is based on surveys that give a status determination in
each area, allowing further management intervention where it is considered necessary.
Indigenous communities also harvest crab for food, social and ceremonial purposes.
Catch opportunities are secured via Aboriginal Communal Fishing Licences, harvest
documents or under fishery treaty agreements. Catch quantities are not set except in
certain councils or under treaties, and Indigenous populations are subject to the same size
limit and trap regulations as commercial fisheries (e.g. all female crabs must be released).

                          In 2019, the Canadian Fisheries Act was amended to include Indigenous knowledge in
                          decision-making regarding fisheries and habitat management, and to explicitly include
Northeast Pacific




                          Indigenous representatives in decision-making.
                          2.3 High seas
                          High seas fisheries in Area 67 mainly consist of Alaska pollock. The Convention on the
                          Conservation and Management of Pollock Resources in the Central Bering Sea (CCBSP)
                          was established to cover the shared Alaska pollock stock in international waters of the
                          central Bering Sea, upon which there is currently a fishing moratorium to enable stock
                          recovery. The Convention does not cover pollock resources within the national jurisdic-
                          tions of the United States or the Russian Federation; those areas remain under the control
                          and management of their respective governments.
                             There are also minor fisheries of sablefish, Pacific halibut and salmon in the high seas
                          region of Area 67. The Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission (NPAFC) was set up to
                          cover all key salmon species across the North Pacific. Its membership includes Canada,
                          Japan, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation and the United States. However,
                          landings of salmon, although historically important, are now minor beyond EEZs.
                             The IPHC is an international organization established by a convention between
                          Canada and the United States to manage the shared Pacific halibut stock. It covers both
                          areas within the EEZs of Canada and the United States as well as the adjoining inter-
                          national waters where halibut stocks occur. However, the portion of landings from the
                          international waters is negligible compared to those within EEZs.
                             Most recently, the North Pacific Fisheries Commission (NPFC) was founded in 2015
                          to manage shared resources in the high seas of both the East and West North Pacific. The
                          Commission has nine members including the United States and Canada, but it is mostly
                          relevant for fisheries in Area 61.

                          3. RESOURCE STATUS

                          3.1 Reference list of stocks
                          The reference list of stocks for Area 67 in this report covers 110 stocks comprising 65
                          species (TABLE D.11.1A and APPENDIX II, TABLE 11A , pp. 459). It includes 84 stock units for the
                          United States and 26 stock units for Canada. In previous FAO assessments, only 34 units
                          were evaluated in total for Area 67. Although the evaluation used the same stock-based
                          information, it reflected species and species groups rather than disaggregated stocks. In
                          contrast, the units in this updated reference list of stocks reflect fisheries management
                          units, which, as far as possible, represent self-replenishing populations. In fact, the number
                          of stocks in this revised list is somewhat inflated due to the inclusion of many salmon
                          stocks, as these are defined based on river basins. Nonetheless, some management units
                          are still species complexes rather than stocks; for example, some skate, flatfish and rock-
                          fish species groups are managed together in Area 67, most likely to reduce management
                          complexity in mixed fisheries and because catches may not have been reported separately.
                          To avoid skewing regional results for Area 67, Pacific salmon was reported as a separate
                          unit (TABLE D.11.1B and APPENDIX II, TABLE 11B , pp. 462 on Pacific salmon). Nonetheless,
                          they are considered in the global estimate (PART C, GLOBAL OVERVIEW, pp. 20).
                             The data and information used to develop the updated reference list of stocks for Area
                          67 was compiled on a stock-by-stock basis from published DFO reports and the published
                          United States stock list, both of which are public. For consistency, the same methodol-
                          ogy is applied to the east and west coasts of the United States and Canada in terms of
                          defining stock status.

3.2 Classification of the status of stocks
3.2.1 METHODOLOGY
Approaches to conducting stock assessments in Canada and the United States vary,
reflecting different policy frameworks. Fisheries in the United States are required to meet
national standards laid out in the Code of Federal Regulations (50 CFR 600.305). Stock
assessments are usually based on age-structured mathematical models in common with
other countries; however, where data are limited, an index-based approach may be used
to allow management to respond to trends in the fisheries.
   Given that modern fisheries have a relatively short history on the West Coast of the
United States, it is usually possible to reconstruct catch histories from the beginning of
the intensive fishery, with many dating back to the early 1900s. However, reconstruction
of these older catches is often a source of uncertainty in stock assessments; while total
quantities of fish removals are usually approximately correct, the quantities by species that
were caught are not always clear. Nevertheless, complete catch histories help define the
unexploited state for the stock (where there is no fishing), which can be used as the basis
for defining reference points, such as the biomass that produces the maximum sustain-
able catch (BMSY). This approach is not universally used, partly because it is not always
possible to reconstruct catch histories, and because changes in stock productivity mean
that the unexploited stock from many years ago is not necessarily a good indicator of what
67                  236                                                         Review of the state of world marine fishery resources




                          the current stock productivity and size would be if no fishing was taking place. Climate
                          change will make current stock status less dependent on historical catches, which is one
Northeast Pacific




                          of the very few positive effects of climate change on stock assessments that have unreli-
                          able early catch data.
                             To define stock status and provide scientific advice, the United States usually uses inte-
                          grated stock assessment models that often include a stock-recruitment relationship as an
                          assumed model if it cannot be fitted empirically. This approach allows estimation of the
                          stock size compared to an unexploited state even where that unexploited state cannot be
                          observed. This is a reasonable approach in terms of decision-making, and justified where
                          stock productivity has been steady over the available data time series. Where this is done
                          and status is reported as a ratio compared to unexploited biomass, status can be deter-
                          mined relative to 20 percent SSB 0 (spawning biomass when the stock is unfished level),
                          below which a stock is overexploited, and 60 percent SSB 0 , over which it is not maximally
                          sustainably fished. Between these two reference levels, a stock is considered maximally
                          sustainably fished. For these integrated approaches, the uncertainty of the status deter-
                          mination is low.
                             Fisheries advice in the United States has often adopted an index-based approach where
                          the integrated model has been rejected in the independent review process. Index-based
                          methods are often difficult to evaluate and include more untestable assumptions, so tend
                          to underestimate uncertainty. However, in some cases, particularly for sedentary shellfish,
                          a survey can obtain a reasonable precautionary absolute abundance estimate and can base
                          recommended harvest on this. In general, other index-based methods have been broadly
                          evaluated, and well evaluated in some cases, such that they have been shown to be robust.
                          Therefore, these differences in uncertainty are not sufficiently far apart to warrant differ-
                          ent classification within the broad determinations in this review.
                             Fisheries assessments in Canada are rooted in a precautionary approach method based
                          on risk assessment which sets a limit reference point (LRP) and an upper stock reference
                          (USR) point which define three zones along the abundance or biomass axis: “critical”,
                          “cautious” and “safe”. The stock assessment is usually the most important input to deter-
                          mine this risk status, but not necessarily the only one.
                             Index-based approaches are effectively decision frameworks as opposed to providing
                          definitive status information; as such, they are designed to deliver long-term safe yields
                          rather than ensure that a stock is in a particular state. Nevertheless, the indices can be
                          interpreted in terms of abundance status. If a stock is in the critical zone, it is considered
                          overfished. Using this method to determine when a stock is underfished is more difficult.
                          The zone between the LRP and USR is the “cautious” zone, and effectively indicates a trig-
                          ger point when management action may be required to avoid the stock falling below the
                          LRP. As a result, it does not indicate that a stock is less than maximally sustainably fished.
                          Unless there is specific evidence otherwise, these stocks are assumed to be maximally
                          sustainably fished instead of underfished. This is often supported by observing that many
                          stocks are below or close to the USR or have dipped below the USR in the recent past.
                          3.2.2 STOCK STATUS
                          The large majority of fishery resources in the Northeast Pacific are sustainably fished
                          (92.7 percent), of which 51.8 percent are underfished and 40.9 percent are maximally
                          sustainably fished (TABLE D.11.2). When weighted by landings, the percentage of sustain-
                          ably fished stocks rises to 99.0 percent (TABLE D.11.3). This reflects the nature of mixed
                          fisheries, where it is not possible (or desirable from an economic or social perspective) to
                          harvest all stocks at a common target level based on single-stock maximum sustainable
                          yield (MSY) estimates. All stocks considered in the reference list for Area 67 are Tier 1
                          (TABLE D.11.2).

   It is important to note that the sustainability index for Area 67 is impacted when
accounting for or discounting salmon stocks (the numbers in TABLES D.11.1A, D.11.2A and
D.11.3A do not include salmon species). As such, two separate indices were produced,
one with salmon and another one without, to assess the overall dynamics in this region.
Previous estimates only assessed Pacific salmon at species level, not stock level; however,
in this report there are 85 specific assessments for salmons, and 110 other assessments
(included in TABLES D.11.1–3) for a total of 195 assessments from the region. If salmon is
included in the calculations for the sustainability index, 82 percent of stocks are classified
as sustainable, as compared to 76.5 percent under the previous approach, which assessed
only 34 species/stocks. However, if salmon is assessed separately as a group, similar to
tunas, 67.1 percent of salmon stocks are classified as sustainable, while 92.7 percent of the
remaining non-salmon stocks are sustainable, thereby presenting a significantly different
perspective of this region. This positive portrait can preliminarily be attributed to the
policy for Alaska pollock which does not aim for maximum yield, but rather to ensure a
stable TAC. This means that other species caught in the Alaska pollock-targeted fishery
are managed at levels way above their BMSY (biomass for MSY).

                          4. KEY SELECTED SPECIES AND GROUPS
                          This section identifies and discusses species and stocks that are currently most important
                          for Area 67 (FIGURE D.11.2).
                          4.1 Alaska pollock
                          Alaska pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) is an abundant semi-pelagic schooling fish found
                          across the North Pacific. It is relatively easy to catch in large quantities at low cost, and
                          as such is a major white fish product on international markets. In Area 67, it represents
                          the dominant catch. While trawling for Alaska pollock mainly occurs off the seabed,
                          there is still some contact with the seafloor, and as such concerns are growing regarding
                          the health of the benthic habitats and ecosystems (MacLean, 2017). In addition, discard
                          rates are typically lower than compared to many other fisheries.
                             Most stock assessment activity for Alaska pollock has been conducted in Alaska, with
                          directed surveys as an important component of the process. Nevertheless, the Bogoslof
                          and Gulf of Alaska stocks depend upon an index-based assessment that only provides
                          relative exploitation advice. Overall, most stocks of Alaska pollock are considered under-
                          fished, with some maximally sustainably fished. For the Bogoslof stock, catches are
                          currently set to zero due to uncertainty over the stock status.

4.2 North Pacific hake
North Pacific hake (Merluccius productus) is most abundant in coastal waters during the
summer when large feeding aggregations are found in depths of 60–600 m (Hamel et
al., 2015). In the early 1960s, only small quantities of North Pacific hake were landed for
local consumption, but the fishery grew rapidly in the late 1960s, initially dominated by
foreign and joint venture fleets taking catches for human consumption and fishmeal. Since
the early 1980s, the catch has been taken by the domestic fleets of the United States and
Canada in their respective national waters, with most of the catch taken by the United
States. A key challenge of the North Pacific hake fishery is that the fish must be frozen
or processed soon after harvest to maintain quality. Currently, most North Pacific hake
is marketed as fillets or as headed and gutted products of relatively low value. In the
past, a large portion of the harvest was processed into surimi, a fish paste widely used to
create other food products. Currently, about half of the stocks of North Pacific hake are
underfished while the other half are maximally sustainably fished.
4.3 Salmon
Catches of salmon, trout and smelt represent a significant proportion of landings in Area
67. The most abundant stocks and catches are in Alaska, with salmon stock size declining
further south. Currently, catches are dominated by sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka), chum
(Oncorhynchus keta) and pink (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) salmon (primarily in Alaska).
Salmon stocks in Area 67 are currently about equal parts overfished, maximally sustain-
ably fished and underfished.
   Salmon have a complex life cycle that includes sea and river habitats, migrating from
their hatching sites in rivers to the ocean where they mature, before returning to the same
rivers to spawn. The species are associated with fresh and brackish water; their anadromous
life cycle makes these stocks particularly dependent on coastal and riverine habitats, which
are often impacted by development. Salmon are also vulnerable to environmental impacts
on riverine habitats as well as climate change, making spawning success and survival vari-
able. Impacts around Alaska and other river systems are less pronounced than around
the Atlantic, so salmon populations have been less affected. Many populations are also
67                  240                                                          Review of the state of world marine fishery resources




                          supported by hatcheries that release juvenile fish into the wild. The overexploited stocks
                          are primarily Chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and Coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch)
Northeast Pacific




                          salmon in British Columbia, Canada, and the west coast of the United States of America.
                             Salmon are predominantly managed locally on the basis of river basins and spawning
                          areas due to the complex nature of their life history. Data on salmon fisheries is usually very
                          accurate compared to other fisheries given that direct counts of return spawners is possible
                          as they migrate upriver. While this may allow accurate monitoring of population size for
                          some stocks, many stocks still lack information about size, and mortality through their
                          life history is still often not well understood. As such, appropriate reference points may
                          still be difficult to estimate. The result is that many stocks have poor estimates of popu-
                          lation status, or lack them altogether. The primary concern is for salmon stocks in more
                          southerly areas (California in particular), where populations tend to be less productive and
                          face greater pressures. In parallel, climate change will likely increase temperature stress
                          on salmon. Among other things, management plans have included stock enhancement
                          through releasing juveniles from hatcheries, particularly for salmon stocks, although this
                          can have adverse impacts on wild populations (McMillan et al., 2023).

                          4.4 Demersal fisheries
                          4.4.1 FLATFISH COMPLEX
                          A wide range of flatfish are taken in the demersal trawl fishery in Area 67, representing an
                          important component of the demersal trawl catch. While yellowfin sole (Limanda aspera)
                          makes up the largest catch, other important flatfish caught include rock sole (Lepidopsetta
                          bilineata) and flathead sole (Hippoglossoides elassodon), and historically Pacific halibut
                          (Hippoglossus stenolepis). Although not traditionally targeted, arrowtooth flounder
                          (Atheresthes stomias) is also a common predator encountered by demersal trawls as it is
                          taken as bycatch. While being an abundant stock, the value of this fish has historically
                          been low due to the poor quality of the flesh. However, today, improved treatment of the
                          catch has increased its marketability and as such it is now caught in significant quantities.
                          Overall, the flatfish complex is considered underfished.
                          4.4.2 PACIFIC HALIBUT
                          Pacific halibut is primarily taken in commercial fisheries using longlines with large circle
                          hooks which tend to have low bycatch, as well as by other fisheries that catch halibut as
                          bycatch. It is also targeted by recreational and subsistence fishers. The former usually use
                          droplines, with captures primarily controlled through licensing, size regulations and
                          bag-limits.
                             Pacific halibut can attain a length of more than 250 cm. Similar to Atlantic hali-
                          but (Hippoglossus hippoglossus), the fish are a popular target species due to high market
                          demand, but they also face similar pressures. The stock is coastwide and the fishery is
                          managed by the IPHC. There is an extensive joint data collection programme to support
                          the stock assessment, which currently indicates that the stock is maximally sustainably
                          fished.
                          4.4.3 ROCKFISH COMPLEX
                          The most important demersal species with respect to management are rockfish or redfish.
                          While rockfish represent quite a valuable part of the catch in Area 67, quantities caught
                          are not large. Overall, most stocks in the rockfish complex are maximally sustainably
                          fished or underfished, with a couple overfished.
                             These are a very diverse group of fish and are found across the region of Area 67.
                          However, most of these species are characterized by long life spans and give birth to
                          relatively small numbers of pelagic larvae rather than eggs, making them vulnerable to
                          fishing; indeed, some stocks have been depleted in the past. For example, the longspine
                          thornyhead (Sebastolobus altivelis) lays a relatively small number of eggs on the seabed,
                          whereas flatfish and sablefish produce a large number of pelagic eggs.
PART D.11 ■ Regional overview ■ Area 67: Northeast Pacific                                      241




   The different fishing vulnerabilities of these species, and the mixed nature of the catch,
make the fishery difficult to manage. The current status is now mixed but generally has
improved as management plans have been implemented. As well as quotas, the species
that are associated with reefs also gain protection from areas closed to fishing to protect
habitats. Even if not an important part of the catch, rockfish may still be critical ‘choke’
species which stop all fishing in a mixed fishery when their quota is reached, so managing
these stocks is important. For example, canary (Sebastes pinniger), chilipepper (Sebastes
goodei) and bocaccio rockfish (Sebastes paucispinis) were depleted in 2000, and by the late
2010s had either recovered or were close to recovered through a rebuilding plan. However,
the rebuilding process of these stocks prevented full harvest of other stocks in the complex
because fishing gears were unable to target individual species.
   Pacific ocean perch (Sebastes alutus) inhabit the outer continental shelf and upper slope
regions of the North Pacific Ocean and the Bering Sea. In the past, higher caches lead
to stock biomass declines in the 1960s and 1970s, which resulted in the lowest catches
in the mid-1980s. Depleted stocks have been recovering slowly since the 1980s, and are
now mostly maximally sustainably fished. Pacific ocean perch stocks have been managed
in some cases within a rockfish species complex, but are now mostly managed as separate
stocks.
4.4.4 SABLEFISH
Sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) primarily inhabit the northeastern Pacific Ocean,
between northern Mexico and the Gulf of Alaska, and westward towards the Aleutian
Islands and into the Bering Sea. Pelagic larvae hatched near the edges of the continental
slope migrate inshore as juveniles, where they grow and then subsequently move offshore
again into deeper water to spawn when they are mature. Adult sablefish are highly mobile,
moving along the coast, and are generally caught at depths greater than 200 m. The main
gear used to catch sablefish has been bottom-set longlines, although they are also caught
in pots and as bycatch in trawls.
   Sablefish have been exploited since the end of the nineteenth century by fishers in the
United States and Canada. A substantial decline of sablefish stocks occurred in the 1970s.
Since then, the fisheries have been rationalized (individual transferable quota, ITQ) and
are now managed through quotas and other management measures (e.g. ten-day fishing
season in 1994). Stocks of sablefish in Area 67 are currently primarily sustainably fished
(underfished or maximally sustainably fished).
4.4.5 ATKA MACKEREL
Atka mackerel (Pleurogrammus monopterygius) is a greenling from the family
Hexagrammidae rather than Scombridae. It spawns demersal eggs that the males tend
within their territories. The species forms semi-pelagic schools that are susceptible to
trawling in the locations and times that they occur each year. The majority of the fisheries
catch for Atka mackerel is taken by catcher/processor vessels in the Aleutian Islands region
and to a lesser extent in the Bering Sea on vessels targeting flatfish, Atka mackerel and
Pacific ocean perch. The fishery is managed using single TACs, with the quota increas-
ingly subdivided into smaller areas to avoid local depletion of the different spawning
components of the stock since 1993 (Sullivan et al., 2024). Currently, Atka mackerel is
considered maximally sustainably fished.
4.5 Pacific herring
Similarly to the Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii)
populations are made up of individual spawning components which may be separated in
autumn and spring. Although there is likely some mixing of components, they can often
be managed in groups as separate units.
   In the past, herring was widely overfished, and many components remain depleted. Of
the stocks that had been assessed – all of which are in Canada – catches remain low but
stocks are considered as effectively recovered. As such, most Pacific herring is considered
maximally sustainably fished.
67                  242                                                         Review of the state of world marine fishery resources




                             There is also a Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) stock which is still considered over-
                          fished and recovering; as such, there is effectively currently no fishery for it. Although
Northeast Pacific




                          some catches of the Pacific sardine stock are taken in Area 67, the majority are taken in
                          Area 77 and it is therefore included under that Area.

                          Dungeness crab (Metacarcinus magister) is found across the west coast of Canada and
                          the United States. It plays an important ecological and economical role in Area 67, even
                          though the landings are low. For instance, in the California Current ecosystem it is
                          critical both as a predator of bivalves and other benthic species and as prey, with its larvae
                          forming an important part of the diet of salmon, rockfish and other fishes (Rasmuson,
                          2013). The Dungeness crab fishery uses baited traps down to 90 m depth on sand and silt
                          habitats, including eelgrass.
                             Dungeness crabs have low vulnerability to fishing due to their early age at reproduc-
                          tive maturity, high fecundity and short life span. However, other threats to the fisheries
                          include parasites, hyper-salinity, ocean acidification on larval crabs, and low oxygen levels,
                          which are all exacerbated by climate change.
                             Management of Dungeness crab is not coastwide, but rather by specific region or state.
                          Measures are focused on trying to ensure sufficient crabs survive to reproduce, preventing
                          overfishing by applying minimum landing size regulations, harvesting only hard-shell
                          males, and applying seasonal closures rather than quotas.
                             Most stocks do not undergo regular stock assessments. For example, Dungeness crab
                          in California is not regularly assessed, and the population has fluctuated widely due to
                          environmental effects rather than fishing. Its components are generally considered to be
                          in a healthy state based on local depletion estimates in the United States (Richerson, Punt
                          and Holland, 2020). In Canada, the same conclusion was reached based on fishery-in-
                          dependent surveys. Overall, Dungeness crab in Area 67 is considered to be maximally
                          sustainably fished.
                          4.6.2 SHRIMPS AND PRAWNS
                          Species of shrimps and prawns are relatively diverse and difficult to separate in landings.
                          For example, of the 90 species of shrimp found in waters of British Columbia, seven of
                          these species (from the Pandalidae family) are harvested by a Canadian shrimp trawl
                          fishery. Despite a large variety of shrimp species in Area 67, landings of commercial
                          trawl fleets are mainly composed of ocean shrimp (Pandalus jordani) and sidestripe
                          shrimp (Pandalus dispar). The fishery varies in complexity from single species harvest
                          to multi-species harvest. In the United States, a number of species (e.g. smelt, rockfish
                          and flatfish) are also present in catches (ODFW, 2025). Cold-water shrimp fisheries have
                          had no stock assessments in the United States, and the management focus has been on
                          bycatch limits. Catches of northern prawn (Pandalus borealis) along the West Coast of
                          the United States have averaged around 13 000 tonnes and the stocks are considered at
                          low risk of overfishing. Overall, shrimps and prawns in Area 67 are currently considered
                          maximally sustainably fished.
                          4.6.3 KING CRABS
                          Three species of king crab are targeted by pot fisheries in Alaska: golden (Lithodes aequi-
                          spinus), blue (Paralithodes platypus) and red king crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus).
                          Fisheries are managed through minimum landing sizes and males-only landings with
                          closed seasons. Catches of king crab have declined substantially since the 1980s, and the
                          productivity of the stocks appears to be currently low. The deeper-water golden king crab
                          appears to be in a better state than other stocks, with the status estimated at maximally
                          sustainably fished. Blue king crabs are considered overfished, and red king crabs have some
                          overfished and some underfished stocks.

5. KEY FINDINGS
Fisheries in Area 67 are primarily managed by the United States and Canada, with the
majority of the catch volume taken in Alaskan waters. Overall, most stocks are healthy
and sustainably fished, several having recovered from past overfishing. The coverage of
assessed stocks in Area 67 represents 96.8 percent of total stocks, representing one of the
highest coverages among FAO Areas. In terms of catch volume and total value, the Alaska
pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) fisheries are dominant. The other larger fisheries are the
mixed demersal trawl and salmon fisheries.
   Area 67 is unique among FAO Areas, because of the large number of small salmon
stocks. These stocks have intentionally been excluded from the overall sustainability
analysis for Area 67, so as not to skew the results. Nonetheless, a comparison between
the sustainability of stocks in Area 67 with or without accounting for salmon provides
interesting insights (Section 3.2.2 of this chapter).
   Compared to the assessment using the past methodology, the percentage of sustain-
ably fished stocks under the updated methodology, in particular underfished stocks,
has substantially increased (TABLE D.11.4). This can be attributed to adding many unique
rockfish stocks which are underfished to the reference list of stocks. In addition, the
previous approach included five different categories of salmon, several of which were not
sustainably fished, which impacted overall sustainability results for Area 67. The updated
assessment for Area 67 does not include salmon species; however, if salmon were included,
the percentage of sustainably fished stocks would drop to 82 percent, which is closer to
what was estimated with the previous approach. When weighted by landings, the contrast
between the previous and updated methodologies becomes less marked (TABLE 4.11.5),
because neither rockfish nor salmon represent a significant percentage of landings.
   Finally, management interventions in all fisheries in Area 67 have rapidly increased in
recent decades, and they now perform better despite difficulties with managing a complex
demersal mixture of species, including vulnerable rockfish and the very large number of
salmon stocks. Results from Area 67 reflect the complexities of mixed fisheries, where
harvesting all stocks at a common target level, based on single-stock MSY estimates, is
neither practical nor always desirable from an economic or social perspective.

  Landings in this region have been stable, and fisheries generally well
   managed. Alaska pollock comprises nearly half of the commercial catch,
   while Pacific salmon is especially valuable to Indigenous communities.
  Marine recreational fisheries are also very significant, especially in
   Canada, both economically and culturally.
  Habitats, such as cold water corals, anemones and kelp forests are
   increasingly protected from the impacts of fishing gear.
  Indigenous communities are most vulnerable to climate change impacts
   that are predicted to affect distribution of marine resources and the
   frequency and severity of extreme events.

1. OVERVIEW
The Western Central Pacific region, designated by FAO as Major Fishing Area 71 (hereaf-
ter, Area 71), includes the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of 23 countries and territories.
With an area of about 33.9 million km2 , it is the second-biggest FAO Major Fishing Area
(FIGURE D.12.1) and has 6.6 million km2 of continental shelf. The geography of the Area
includes continental, island and archipelagic countries, with over 600 million inhabitants.
For instance, Indonesia has more than 17 000 islands, while the Philippines has 7 641
in its territorial waters. In addition, the Central Pacific is home to hundreds of sparsely
populated and unpopulated islands.

                                   Area 71 hosts one of the world’s largest fishing fleets (over 1.7 million vessels) and is
                                among the regions with the highest number of fishers (about 4.8 million people), and
Western Central Pacific




                                represents the second ranked Area in terms of landings worldwide (13.5 million tonnes
                                in 2021). It supports the largest number of artisanal and small-scale fishers in the world,
                                and is thus important in terms of nutrition and livelihoods. In Area 71, five Southeast
                                Asian countries (Indonesia, Viet Nam, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand) have
                                historically dominated the reported catches.
                                   Tunas, bonitos and billfishes (e.g. skipjack tuna [Katsuwonus pelamis], yellowfin tuna
                                [Thunnus albacares], kawakawa [Euthynnus affinis] and others) account for 27 percent
                                of the total reported catch in the Area. Moreover, small pelagic fishes (e.g. sardines,
                                anchovies, scads and others), which are almost exclusively reported by Southeast Asian
                                countries, represent 16 percent of the total reported catch. Cephalopods (squids, cuttlefish
                                and octopus) account for 5 percent of the reported catch by weight. However, multiple
                                issues exist with catch reporting in Area 71, which are a challenge for the accuracy of
                                stock status analysis.
                                   Most of the countries in Area 71 are developing countries, and their communities
                                depend on reef fishes and other coastal species for food security and livelihoods (Gillett
                                and Tauati, 2018; Pomeroy, 2012). Due to extensive fishing of inshore stocks and, in
                                many cases, unregulated use of anchored fish aggregating devices (aFADs) (Widyatmoko,
                                Hardesty and Wilcox, 2021) and lamps (Candelario, Gonzales and Jardin, 2018), some
                                large and small pelagic species are experiencing localized depletion (Bintoro et al., 2022;
                                Mallawa et al., 2021; Yutuc, Vallejo and Mendoza, 2018) despite being more resilient
                                than many coral reef species (Birkeland, 2017).
                                2. FISHERY PROFILES
                                Area 71 has diverse marine seascapes and social, cultural, economic and political charac-
                                teristics, making its fisheries highly complex. This chapter organizes fishery profiles for
                                Area 71 into five subregions and presents status assessments for each separately: (1) the
                                Central Pacific, which predominantly comprises small island developing states (SIDS), (2)
                                the high seas, which incorporates results for stocks straddling all of Area 71, (3) northern
                                Australia, including the Northern Territory and Queensland, (4) the South China Sea,
                                which only contains regions not within current EEZs, and (5) Southeast Asia, the most
                                significant contributor to total reported catches in Area 71.
                                2.1 The Central Pacific
                                The Pacific island countries and territories in Area 71 include the Federated States of
                                Micronesia, Fiji, Guam, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, New Caledonia, the
                                Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, Vanuatu,
                                and the Wallis and Futuna Islands. Small land areas characterize the countries in the
                                Central Pacific subregion, with vast and deep open-ocean regions in their EEZs. The
                                exception is Papua New Guinea, which has the largest land area and the most significant
                                coastal catch because it also has the largest population in the subregion (Gillett and
                                Fong, 2023). Most of the population in the Central Pacific resides in coastal areas. As
                                such, coastal fishing has a rich cultural significance and is vital for food security and
                                local income. These countries have some of the highest fish consumption rates globally,
                                and approximately 70 percent of the coastal catch is for subsistence (Gillett and Fong,
                                2023). Fisheries are largely artisanal, small-scale, coastal fisheries, targeting more than
                                500 nearshore pelagic and coastal reef finfish and invertebrate species (Preston, 2005).
                                   The subregion has two main fishing sectors: industrial oceanic fisheries, which target
                                the four main tuna species (skipjack [Katsuwonus pelamis], yellowfin [Thunnus albacares],
                                bigeye [Thunnus obesus] and albacore [Thunnus alalunga]); and coastal fisheries, which are
                                almost exclusively small-scale fishers targeting many species of coastal fishes and inverte-
                                brates for livelihoods and subsistence. The total catch reported to FAO from the 14 Central
                                Pacific islands for 2021 was around 922 900 tonnes, approximately 7 percent of the total
                                reported for Area 71 (FAO, 2024). Of the reported catch, 94.9 percent (875 800 tonnes)
                                came from oceanic tuna fisheries, of which 872 500 tonnes were the four main target tuna

species. Therefore, the reported coastal fisheries catch in the subregion was 47 200 tonnes
(FAO, 2024). Other independent catch estimates (Gillett and Fong, 2023) indicate that
actual catches may be higher than those reported to FAO for both sectors.
    Although fishery data collection and reporting for oceanic fisheries are considered
advanced, the total oceanic catch for the subregion formally reported by countries to
FAO is approximately half of that reported by these countries to the Western and Central
Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) for 2021 (1 515 500 tonnes; Gillett and Fong,
2023). This issue is also evident in the coastal fisheries component of catches reported
to FAO. The total reported to FAO is significantly lower than a comparative estimate of
149 000 tonnes for 2021 (Gillett and Fong, 2023). Although numerous uncertainties
exist in calculating the latter, we consider it a more accurate estimate of coastal catch
in the subregion. The low resolution in reported data and evidence of under-reporting
for coastal catches is primarily due to the fact that coastal fisheries, including coastal
tuna fisheries, are often less sampled less reliable and less documented in the subregion,
compared to higher-value tuna fisheries that have specific allocations (e.g. total allowable
catch) and monitoring (Gillett and Fong, 2023; Gillett and Tauati, 2018; Gillett, Lewis
and Cartwright, 2014). The most significant concern for communities in this subregion
is that most local fish are used for domestic consumption, and fishing incomes come from
coastal fishing (Gillett and Fong, 2023).
    The region faces some of the world’s toughest challenges in adapting to climate change.
Welch et al. (in press) project that climate change will reduce catches in these countries
by 11–73 percent by 2050 under the high-emissions scenario. These issues present current
and emerging threats to coastal fisheries and people in the region.
2.2 The high seas
The high seas subregion is included separately to better describe transboundary species
in Area 71. There are four main target tuna species caught in this region: bigeye tuna,
skipjack tuna, yellowfin tuna and albacore. WCPFC is the regional fishery advisory body
in the region that has a mandate to provide advice to manage transboundary resources of
migratory tunas and tuna-like species (sharks and billfish). As such, species that are caught
in oceanic waters by industrial and semi-industrial vessels are under WCPFC’s jurisdic-
tion. Fisheries in this subregion also target billfishes (black marlin [Istiompax indica],
blue marlin [Makaira nigricans], striped marlin [Kajikia audax], Indo-Pacific sailfish
[Istiophorus platypterus], swordfish [Xiphias gladius] and shortbill spearfish [Tetrapturus
angustirostris]), oceanic sharks (silky shark [Carcharhinus falciformis], oceanic whitetip
shark [Carcharhinus longimanus], blue shark [Prionace glauca], thresher shark [Alopias
vulpinus] and mako sharks [Isurus spp.]), manta rays and finfish species (including wahoo
[Acanthocybium solandri] and common dolphinfish [Coryphaena hippurus]). However,
there is an overlap of reported catches/landings from the high-seas with those from EEZs
since countries report individually to FAO, including high-seas species taken in their
waters (WCPFC, 2023).
   The WCPFC monitors and manages high-seas species, conducts frequent and exten-
sive assessments, and provides observer coverage for fishing fleets. While there have been
improvements in the accuracy of shark species identification and their traceability in
recent years, areas of concern remain. Illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing
is an ongoing issue for high-seas fisheries.
   Temperature and ocean circulation determine the distribution and abundance of
highly migratory species in the high-seas subregion. This relationship is well demonstrated
by substantial fluctuations in catches correlated with phases of the El Niño Southern
Oscillation (Lehodey et al., 1997). Using well-established spatially-structured popula-
tion dynamics models, the WCPFC conducts regular stock assessments for the four main
target tuna species (Castillo-Jordán et al., 2022).
2.3 Northern Australia
The Northern Australia subregion includes the Northern Territory, Queensland and
many islands, having a combined coastline length of 24 306 km (Geoscience Australia,
71                        252                                                           Review of the state of world marine fishery resources


                                2004). The EEZ of these jurisdictions includes diverse environmental conditions and
                                habitat types, covering tropical shallow waters influenced by seasonal monsoonal freshwater
Western Central Pacific




                                flows, subtropical coastal sandy beaches, coral reefs including the Great Barrier Reef,
                                extensive areas of mangrove and seagrass beds, shallow and deep-water shoals, continental
                                shelf slopes, and deep open ocean.
                                   As such, this subregion contains diverse fisheries and target species. The Northern
                                Australia subregion has nearshore continental shelf fisheries targeting a range of finfish and
                                invertebrate species, including barramundi (Lates calcarifer), prawns, mud crabs, goldband
                                snapper (also known as goldbanded jobfish, Pristipomoides multidens), grey mackerel (also
                                known as broad-barred king mackerel, Scomberomorus semifasciatus), threadfin salmon
                                (also known as fourfinger threadfin, Eleutheronema tetradactylum), Spanish mackerel
                                (Scomberomorus maculatus), coral grouper (Epinephelus corallicola), tailor (also known as
                                bluefish, Pomatonus salvatrix), sharks, rays, whiting, sea mullet (also known as flathead
                                grey mullet, Mugil cephalus), yellowfin bream (also known as surf bream, Acanthopagrus
                                australis), squid and sea cucumbers. The northern and east coast prawn trawl are two of
                                this subregion’s most significant and valuable fisheries.
                                   Their management is organized by jurisdiction, with some fisheries managed under
                                federal legislation. While not regarded as highly productive fisheries relative to global
                                totals, the economic input to the local economy from commercial fishing and through
                                associated industries is significant. Recreational, charter and Indigenous fishery sectors
                                are also substantial in this subregion.
                                   The total catch volume reported by Australia to FAO in 2021 was 27 196 tonnes, less
                                than 1 percent of the total for Area 71. Prawn species comprise 36.1 percent of the reported
                                catch, with tunas and bonitos approximately 13.5 percent (FAO, 2024). As is the case in
                                the Central Pacific subregion, there is evidence that reported catches to FAO underrepre-
                                sent the actual level of catches in Northern Australia.
                                2.4 The South China Sea
                                In the northwest of Area 71, the South China Sea covers around 3.5 million km2 . It is less
                                productive than other subregions, yet has a high level of marine biodiversity with more
                                than 6 500 species. It stretches from the Strait of Malacca in the southwest to FAO Major
                                Fishing Area 61 in the north, although its geographic extent goes to the Strait of Taiwan.
                                The subregion includes the Paracel and Spratly Islands and hundreds of other islands and
                                reefs. The waters around them have abundant oil, natural gas, mineral and aquatic food
                                reserves. The lack of information on fish caught by fishing zones did not allow this report to
                                extract the proportion of the catch in this subregion. The numbers in this report came from
                                various publications that assessed species at this geographical level; specifically, information
                                was found for two small pelagic and four large pelagic fish species. The Asia-Pacific Fishery
                                Commission (APFIC) is a regional fisheries body established to promote the full and
                                proper utilization of living aquatic resources through the development and management
                                of fishing and culture operations, as well as the development of related processing and
                                marketing activities in conformity with the objectives of its Members. However, during
                                its 37th Session the Commission (2023) agreed to suspend all its activities for a period of
                                five year after which Members will reconvene to consider its future.
                                2.5 Southeast Asia
                                The Southeast Asian countries in Area 71 are Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia,
                                Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Timor-Leste and Viet Nam. Countries
                                in the west of Area 71 (Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Viet Nam) border the Gulf of
                                Thailand Large Marine Ecosystem (LME), which covers an area of around 400 000 km2 .
                                This gulf is relatively shallow, with a mean depth of 45 m and a maximum depth of 80 m
                                (Piyakarnachana, 1989, 1999). It is highly productive due to the considerable nutrient
                                input from rivers, fertilizers, sewage and aquaculture operations (Piyakarnachana, 1999).
                                   The seas surrounding Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Timor-
                                Leste, Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands are within the Coral Triangle, a region
                                unparalleled in marine biodiversity. It extends over 5.7 million km2 , contains the world’s
                                largest mangrove forest as well as over 76 percent of the world’s shallow-water reef-building
PART D.12 ■ Regional overview ■ Area 71: Western Central Pacific                                                                 253


coral species, 37 percent of all reef fish species and six out of seven of the sea turtle species
(Asaad et al., 2018). The fish caught in this region are consumed locally as well as exported
nationally and internationally. In addition, a large industry collects fish, corals, giant clams
and other animals for the ornamental aquarium trade.
   This subregion is home to some of the most complex fisheries in the world. The large
number of species captured, variety of gears and vessels used, and complex geography all
contribute to make the task of data collection and fisheries management a challenging
one. In 2021, Southeast Asian countries caught a reported 11.8 million tonnes, of which
25 percent was marine fishes NEI. When we include other general categories (e.g. order,
family, genus), of the total catch reported to FAO by Southeast Asian countries, around
73 percent is unidentified at the species level. This subregion contributed 88 percent to the
total catch of Area 71 in 2021. Therefore, the lack of species identification in this subre-
gion affects all of Area 71. Additionally, species misidentification is ubiquitous due to the
immense diversity of species caught. Also, identification is difficult due to capturing juve-
niles of many species which are morphologically different from the adults.
   The subregion’s resources and environment suffer, inter alia, from overfishing, damaging
fishing techniques (including poisons and explosives), pollution, the pervasive capture of
immature animals, ocean acidification and habitat destruction. Additionally, climate change
significantly impacts coral reefs through bleaching and displaces species that cannot with-
stand increasing water temperatures (Cheung et al., 2010). Finally, despite recent efforts, IUU
fishing continues to affect Southeast Asian fisheries, both by foreign and local fleets fishing.
3. RESOURCE STATUS
3.1 Reference list of stocks
This report of the state of stocks for Area 71 includes a revision of the reference list of stocks
(APPENDIX II, TABLE 12 , pp. 463), with revisions to better incorporate relevant and vital
species for each country. To achieve this, the reference list of stock criteria adopted under
Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14.4.1 reporting was promoted, including available
catch composition data, and national fisheries departments were consulted. The key to this
process was to accept that species lists would not be exhaustive, but rather that they would
comprise a manageable and representative number of species for routine monitoring purposes.
Aggregating all species across countries provided the revised list for current stock status
reporting.
   In this report under the updated methodology (PART B, METHODOLOGY, pp. 6) the
reference list of stocks for Area 71 covers 142 species or species groups and 263 stocks
(assessment units) (TABLE D.12.1).

                                   The restricted spatial coverage of data collection constrains the country-specific approach
                                for determining stock status. Where the spatial extent of the main fished areas is relatively
Western Central Pacific




                                limited, applying available assessment outcomes to the national scale, regardless of the
                                spatial scale of data collection, is less of an issue since they often represent a single stock (e.g.
                                some small island states). For larger countries, country-level stock status for each species
                                based on the available information is reported, assuming that the status is representative of
                                that species and acknowledging that additional biological stocks may exist in that country.
                                In cases where data from various areas in a country exist, this report treated them as sepa-
                                rate stocks if the biological characteristics and the distances between them warranted it.
                                   Despite several studies highlighting uncertainties, knowledge of the stock structure for
                                the four main tuna species captured in Area 71 suggests that, at this scale, each consists of a
                                single stock (Moore et al., 2020). The only exception may be albacore (Thunnus alalunga), for
                                which there is evidence of separate Northern and Southern Pacific Ocean stocks (Nikolic et
                                al., 2017). The two oceanic shark species included in the current assessment also mix across
                                large spatial scales. However, recent research has suggested the possibility of genetic struc-
                                turing within the Indo-Pacific region for silky sharks (Carcharhinus falciformis) (Clarke et
                                al., 2015; Ruck, 2016). This report includes assessments for the stock status of the four main
                                target tuna species and the two oceanic shark species on the scale of Area 71.
                                   Conversely, knowledge of the stock structure for the many coastal fishery species
                                captured in Area 71 is generally poor. Furthermore, where stock structure studies assess
                                contemporary levels of connectivity, they primarily use genetic data, which can be limited
                                when compared to alternative methods in detecting the separation of stocks at finer spatial
                                and temporal scales applicable to fisheries management (Welch et al., 2015). Therefore,
                                while some species investigated here are likely to have more than one stock within a coun-
                                try, a species may legitimately be a single stock for some countries, even when covering
                                large areas with dispersed islands. Nonetheless, knowing the appropriate spatial scale for
                                assessment with certainty is only possible with local studies. Available studies indicate
                                high variability in connectivity for tropical marine species, and these studies can inform
                                plausible spatial scales of stocks for key species assessed (Barton et al., 2018; Craig et al.,
                                2007; Horne et al., 2011; Newman et al., 2010; Rasheeq et al., 2023; Skillings, Bird
                                and Toonen, 2014; Szabo et al., 2014; Welch et al., 2015). While a full search and use
                                of relevant studies is beyond the scope of the current study, it would help build a more
                                appropriate framework for assessing stock status at the relevant scales and facilitate more
                                accurate reporting of stock status across Area 71 in the future.
                                3.2 Classification of the status of stocks
                                Results indicate that 124 stocks in Area 71 are overfished, 78 stocks are maximally
                                sustainably fished, and 61 stocks are underfished – and thus that 52.9 percent of stocks are
                                sustainably fished (TABLE D.12.2). While this is significantly lower than previous estimates
                                for 2021 under the previous methodology (65.2 percent), the revised species list, the greater
                                number of stocks, and finer resolution by country, ensure that the current estimate is based
                                on the best available information.
                                   In contrast to other FAO Major Fishing Areas where the percentage of sustaina-
                                ble landings from the updated methodology presented a healthier picture of the state
                                of exploitation of stocks, for Area 71 the percentage of sustainable stocks dropped to
                                45 percent when weighted by landings (TABLE D.12.3). This is due to the fact that tuna
                                species, which are in an overall better state of exploitation than coastal species, make up
                                about 26.9 percent of landings in the Area in 2021; however, the updated methodology
                                excludes tuna species in its assessment of stock status weighted by landings. This is because
                                they are highly migratory species and also occur in Area 61 and Area 77. As such, the
                                percentage of sustainable stocks appears lower as it particularly reflects the state of coastal
                                resources (if tuna were included in the assessment weighted by landings, the percentage of
                                sustainable stocks for Area 71 would increase to about 60 percent instead of 45 percent).
                                In addition, this is why the amount of landings from assessed stocks is only 4.54 million
                                tonnes; if tunas were incorporated, this number would be just over 6.9 million tonnes.

   Stock status information for ten Central Pacific subregion countries and territories
was sourced. From these ten countries and the final species list, there was stock status
information for 121 stocks; of these, 24 were underfished, 42 maximally sustainably
fished and 55 overfished. This analysis found that 55 percent of this subregion’s stocks
were biologically sustainably fished. While countries in this region have 5–25 species on
their respective national reference lists of stocks, we did not include all species based on
available assessments and the agreed-upon list. Two countries had assessments for one to
two species, each by expert judgement. All assessments were Tier 3. Five countries’ status
information came from 2018 (four stocks) and 2016 (one stock) assessments, and on this
basis alone we assigned these assessments a high level of uncertainty. Published informa-
tion was absent or unavailable for eight countries and territories, and several countries
failed to respond to requests for information. Therefore, the stock status information
currently reported for this subregion is incomplete.
   Stock status information for the high seas subregion was provided for skipjack tuna
(Katsuwonus pelamis), yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares), bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus)
and albacore, since these represent the main target species in the Pacific Ocean. In addi-
tion, two shark species taken in the tuna fishery – oceanic whitetip (Carcharhinus
longimanus) and silky (Carcharhinus falciformis) sharks – were also included, as they are
a major bycatch species and present an important conservation concern. Tier 1 assess-
ment methods were used for all these species, with the exception of the silky shark, which
Kindong et al. (2022) assessed using length-based spawning potential ratio and length-
based Bayesian biomass estimator methods (Tier 3).

                                   The most recent stock assessments determined that the four tuna species were sustain-
                                ably fished. Skipjack tuna, assessed in 2022, had spawning biomass compared to unfished
Western Central Pacific




                                levels of 0.46 (Castillo-Jordán et al., 2022). Vincent et al. (2020), Ducharme-Barth (2020)
                                and Castillo-Jordán (2021) estimated spawning biomass relative to unfished levels as 0.54
                                for yellowfin tuna, 0.38 for bigeye tuna and 0.36 for albacore tuna, respectively. Therefore,
                                skipjack tuna and yellowfin tuna are considered underfished, while bigeye tuna and alba-
                                core are maximally sustainably fished1 (see PART E.1, GLOBAL TUNA FISHERIES, pp. 330). Given
                                that both bycatch shark species are overfished, overall 67 percent of high-seas stocks are
                                biologically sustainably fished.
                                   The assessment results for the Northern Australia subregion were primarily based on
                                those included in the most recent SDG 14.4.1 reporting period. These results included
                                11 stocks assessed using Tier 1 assessments and comprising two finfish species, one lobster
                                species, and three species groupings of shrimp. The 11 stocks included four stocks of narrow-
                                barred Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus commerson), one stock of Malabar blood snapper
                                (Lutjanus malabaricus), one of ornate spiny lobster (Panulirus ornatus), one of the prawn
                                species complex (Penaeus indicus/Penaeus merguiensis), and two stocks for each species
                                complex Metapenaeus endeavouri/Metapenaeus ensis and Penaeus esculentus/Penaeus semi-
                                sulcatus.2 Ten stocks (91 percent) were sustainably fished.
                                   Of the six species included in this report from the South China Sea, mackerel scad
                                (Decapterus macarellus), short mackerel (Rastrelliger brachysoma) and narrow-barred
                                Spanish mackerel were overfished, while kawakawa (Euthynnus affinis), Indo-Pacific king
                                mackerel (Scomberomorus guttatus) and longtail tuna (Thunnus tonggol) are sustainably
                                fished. Therefore, 50 percent of the stocks assessed in this subregion are sustainably fished.
                                   Of the nine Southeast Asian countries in Area 71, stock status information was found
                                for seven (information for Singapore and Timor-Leste was not found). Most stock statuses
                                were Tier 3 (except a few in Thailand), and most had high uncertainty due to the method-
                                ology or the assessment year. Overall, the seven countries with assessments had 97 stocks,
                                26 of which were estimated to be underfished, 23 maximally sustainably fished, and 48
                                overfished. Therefore, 51 percent of the stocks in this subregion were found to be sustaina-
                                bly fished. While most Southeast Asian countries in Area 71 had stock assessments, three
                                countries only assessed one species. Six countries had assessments dating back to 2016, the
                                cut-off year used in this report.
                                4. KEY SELECTED SPECIES AND GROUPS
                                This section identifies and discusses species and stocks that are currently most important
                                for Area 71 (FIGURE D.12.2).
                                4.1 Tunas
                                Tunas (Scombridae) are essential for Area 71 as they are highly valued and targeted by
                                many local and foreign industrial and semi-industrial vessels. They also support small-scale
                                domestic and artisanal fisheries. The four main target tuna species are skipjack (Katsuwonus
                                pelamis), yellowfin (Thunnus albacares), bigeye (Thunnus obesus) and albacore (Thunnus
                                alalunga). However, these fleets catch other large oceanic finfish and sharks, primarily as
                                bycatch. Tunas caught in Area 71 and some adjacent areas comprise most of the global
                                commercial tuna catch (Moore et al., 2020). The WCPFC has well-organized management,
                                monitoring and surveillance. However, catch statistics reporting is challenging due to
                                numerous domestic vessels in some countries and foreign ships from multiple countries
                                fishing in individual EEZs and international waters (WCPFC, 2023).
                                   Despite the WCPFC finding the overall condition of tropical tuna and other species as
                                biologically sustainably fished in Area 71, local depletion of essential species like skipjack
                                tuna and yellowfin tuna is common in Southeast Asia. These are the result of overcapacity,
                                excessive effort, and capture at small sizes, among other problems (Bintoro et al., 2022;
                                Mallawa et al., 2021; Yutuc, Vallejo and Mendoza, 2018).

                                    indicating that BMSY would occur substantially below 0.5 B0.

4.2 Small pelagic fishes
Small pelagic finfish species (such as anchovies, sardines, herrings, scads) are essential for
coastal communities in Area 71, and their relative importance is far greater in Southeast
Asia. Although they are not major target species in northern Australia, artisanal fishers
target them throughout much of the Pacific islands region. In spite of this, a lack of moni-
toring means that the catches of small pelagic species in the Pacific islands are unknown.
These species have become more important for local consumption as coral reef and other
coastal fishes, like groupers and snappers, have been overfished. However, they are under
increasing pressure from pollution, habitat loss (mangroves) and overexploitation. The
unregulated use of lamps and the large number of vessels catching them place these stocks
under tremendous pressure, and some stocks are overfished.
4.3 Sharks, skates and rays
Many elasmobranchs are susceptible to overfishing due to life history characteristics,
including slower growth, lower fecundity, longer lives and late maturity. Commercial
fisheries capture sharks in northern Australia, and these are comprehensively managed
and sustainable.3
   Shark, skate and ray catch data in the Pacific islands region and Southeast Asia are
extremely poor. However, fishers harvest these species and, in many areas, they are depleted
compared to historical levels (Welch, unpublished data). There has been increasing concern
that elasmobranchs captured in oceanic fisheries have experienced significant declines,
with two of the major species (silky shark [Carcharhinus falciformis] and oceanic whitetip
[Carcharhinus longimanus]) reported as being overfished.
   Southeast Asia’s largest targeted elasmobranch fisheries are in Indonesia and the
Philippines (Clark-Shen et al., 2023). There are at least 273 species of marine elasmo-
branchs (IUCN, 2021) in that subregion, several of which are of conservation concern
(Clark-Shen et al., 2023). Artisanal, semi-industrial and industrial vessels catch elasmo-
branchs of multiple species, and due to weak legislation and enforcement they capture
many juveniles and locally prohibited species (Moreno, personal observations). Because
the area holds so many endemic species with restricted distributions, the strict regulation
of their fisheries is essential.

                                4.4 Coastal and coral-reef species
Western Central Pacific




                                Coastal finfish and invertebrates are critical in Southeast Asia and the Pacific islands
                                subregions, where coastal communities rely heavily on them for food security as a signifi-
                                cant source of protein and for local livelihoods. This reliance, along with rapidly increasing
                                human populations, improvements in fishing technology and gear availability, and low
                                capacity for monitoring and management, have resulted in significant declines in many
                                species. Historically vital species, including invertebrates like sea cucumbers and large
                                predators like groupers and snappers, have become rare in Southeast Asia and many Pacific
                                islands. Their proximity to the shore, desirability, high value and life history characteristics
                                make them vulnerable to overexploitation. Furthermore, recent studies of the projected
                                impacts of climate change indicate that the biomass of coastal finfish and invertebrates
                                within Area 71 will experience significant declines within the next 10 to 30 years, further
                                exacerbating current sustainability concerns (Blanchard and Novaglio, 2024; Welch et
                                al., in press). Primary fisheries management for coastal fisheries is urgently needed in
                                many countries (Welch, 2024).

                                5. KEY FINDINGS
                                This report estimates that 52.9 percent of the assessed stocks in Area 71 are biologically
                                sustainably fished. The percentage of stocks estimated to be sustainably fished is similar for
                                the two main subregions of Area 71, at 55 percent for the Central Pacific and 51 percent
                                for Southeast Asia. TABLES D.12.4 and D.12.5 provide a comparison between results from
                                the updated and previous FAO state of stocks assessments, based on the 2021 data. The
                                drop in biologically sustainably fished stocks is not due to a change in their condition
                                but instead is linked to the use of an updated methodology, which includes a significant
                                increase to the number of stocks assessed, thereby improving the representativeness of
                                status reporting and providing a more accurate reflection of the current context of fisheries
                                in Area 71. The coverage of 51.3 percent of landings in 2021 is slightly higher than the
                                previous coverage of 48.9 percent for the same reference year.
                                   Despite these improvements in the reliability of the regional assessment, stock assess-
                                ments and relevant information are still overall limited in Area 71. The species for which
                                stock status was determined in each country were generally ad hoc and often the subject of
                                opportunistic and snapshot-type data collections typically conducted by non-government
                                and external experts. Of note is that the majority of stock status information for Area 71
                                was derived from Tier 3 assessments, including some assessments from local expert judge-
                                ment; the exception being northern Australia and most high-seas stocks associated with
                                valuable tuna fisheries. In addition, over 64 percent of the total reported catch in Area
                                71 came from mixed-species groups that were only used in this analysis for comparative
                                purposes, given that they cannot accurately inform on the status of the stocks (noting that
                                some species groupings may be valid). For example, the country with the largest catches
                                in the Area, Viet Nam, reports 79.2 percent of its catch in two categories: marine fishes
                                NEI and tuna-like fishes NEI.
                                   In Area 71, as with some other FAO Major Fishing Areas, the data also show fluctua-
                                tions that reflect challenges with the reliability of data collection, collation and analysis.
                                Furthermore, data collectors or managers may apportion a species in FAO’s historical
                                stock list to various categories due to poor species identification. These issues are signifi-
                                cant obstacles to using catch data to determine a species or stock status.
                                   The assessment information for this report was obtained from multiple sampling
                                locations in various countries. However, for each country, the sampling location for a
                                particular species was unique and a single location. Without further data, it was assumed
                                that outputs from these assessments represented the country-level status for a given species,
                                even where other stocks for the same species were likely to exist. In some cases, the assess-
                                ments for single species from different locations were collected within the same country.
                                Expert judgement and existing literature were used to determine whether each location
PART D.12 ■ Regional overview ■ Area 71: Western Central Pacific                                                                                                                                          259




likely represented a separate stock. Where separate stocks were determined, the assessment
results from each area were treated independently. While the status at the stock level is
reported in this report (APPENDIX II, TABLE 12 , pp. 463), comprehensive knowledge of the
spatial scale of stocks and their structure is lacking. It should be acknowledged that some
countries may have several stocks of the same species while others may be shared across
adjacent countries. Due to the region’s scarcity of stock status information, assessments
dating back to 2016 were included.
   Finally, a continued focus on collating information on the status of fished species at the
stock level in future FAO stock status reporting and on using the best available information
will continue to improve the accuracy and paint a more meaningful picture of stock status
in Area 71. Many countries and territories in Area 71 have reduced capacity to monitor
and assess stocks; national reference lists of stocks need to be refined to make the best use
of limited resources. Supporting these nations in achieving this goal and using data-limited
assessment approaches appropriate to local contexts will help significantly improve the accu-
racy in reporting Area 71 stock status in the future.

  The number of people who depend on fisheries in Area 71, both directly
   and indirectly, is the largest of any Area in the world and the majority of
   landings are consumed locally.
  Tunas are key target species and a major source of revenue in the Area.
   The current status of tuna resources is highly sustainable, in part due to
   management procedures instituted by WCPFC. However, the distribution
   and abundance of tunas are likely to be negatively impacted by climate
   change.
  Many local communities depend on the ocean for their livelihood and
   nutrition, which are under threat from climate change.

1. OVERVIEW
The Eastern Central Pacific, designated by FAO as Major Fishing Area 77 (hereafter,
Area 77), encompasses the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of Costa Rica, El Salvador,
Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, and the United States of America
(hereafter, United States). Area 77 is recognized as a productive fishing ground, with
catches primarily consisting of large and small pelagics, snappers, groupers, tunas and
shrimps, among others. The majority of the catch by tonnage in this region is landed by
industrial and semi-industrial fisheries, primarily operating on the continental shelf and
at the shelf edge (i.e. trawling, purse-seining and longlining). Furthermore, Area 77 also
supports a significant proportion of artisanal and small-scale fisheries, which face increasing

                                pressures from overfishing. These contribute significantly to the economies of the coastal

Eastern Central Pacific




                                being particularly important fishery producers in the region. These fisheries are often
                                capital-intensive, fleet-based enterprises which yield substantial landings; however, the
                                number of jobs and livelihoods directly dependent on these resources can vary significantly.
                                   The biological productivity of Area 77 is influenced by several oceanic currents,
                                including the California Current, the North Pacific Current and the North Equatorial
                                Current (FAO, 2011). The primary temporal variation scales affecting the fishing sector
                                are interannual and multidecadal, with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
                                phenomenon being a major source of interannual environmental change, showing domi-
                                nant signals every two to seven years (Lluch-Cota et al., 2018). Longer-term climatic
                                variability is represented by periodicities in various environmental indices, such as sea
                                surface temperature, ranging from 20 to 60 years (Chavez et al., 2003). These varia-
                                tions can significantly impact fishery resources, leading to fluctuations in biomass and
                                catch availability. Indeed, during El Niño events, the abundance of species like Pacific
                                sardine (Sardinops sagax) and California anchovy (Engraulis mordax) can be affected,
                                influencing the overall productivity of the fisheries. For example, in the Mexican Pacific,
                                both interannual and multidecadal variations have been shown to affect fishery resources
                                and the ecosystems that support them. This generally leads to negative consequences for
                                the sector, as biomass – and, consequently, available catch – can decrease by up to 136 000
                                tonnes. However, shrimp and squid catches have shown increases during El Niño events
                                (Bertrand et al., 2020). Some regions of Area 77 are also influenced by other oceanic
                                characteristics; for instance, El Salvador’s fisheries are influenced by a shallow thermo-
                                cline, seasonal shifts in the Intertropical Convergence Zone, and coastal wind jets that
                                create cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies. Upwelling zones, such as the Costa Rica Dome,
                                and the Eastern Boundary Current system also significantly affect marine productivity
                                and species distribution.
                                   The history of marine resource utilization in this region is shaped by colonial legacies and
                                the industrial development of fisheries. Each country has developed its fisheries sector within
                                different historical and political contexts. Many coastal communities in Area 77 continue
                                to depend on marine resources, although several fish stocks are showing signs of overfishing.
                                   Climate change, pollution and overexploitation also pose significant threats to fish-
                                ery resources and the artisanal fishers who depend on them. The current trend shows a
                                decline in the abundance of many species – and, consequently, in fishing profitability.
                                An increase in sea surface temperature and a reduction in oxygenated zones in the water
                                column have been observed (FAO, 2018).
                                   Moreover, the growth of commercial catches over the years has led to the depletion of
                                some inshore resources. While certain species are managed effectively, others are over-
                                fished, and data on artisanal and semi-industrial fisheries are often limited. This creates
                                uncertainty regarding the status of these unassessed resources, which represent a notable
                                portion of landings in the region. This situation poses significant challenges regarding
                                food security and poverty alleviation.
                                2. FISHERY PROFILES
                                The fisheries in Area 77 have multiple jurisdictions that correspond to the EEZs of
                                countries in the Area; the subsections below outline the fisheries profiles for each country.
                                2.1 The United States of America
                                The United States’ Pacific coast fisheries are significant due to their extensive range and
                                the diverse marine resources they encompass. The region under Area 77 spans the Pacific
                                coastline from the border between the United States and Mexico, to northern California.
                                   The United States has both industrial and artisanal fishing fleets, targeting a wide
                                variety of species. The industrial fleets primarily target species such as tuna, small pelag-
                                ics and groundfish. The tuna fleet operates in the central and southern regions of the
                                United States’ Pacific EEZ (thus, within the scope of Area 77), using longlines and purse
                                seines to capture species like albacore (Thunnus alalunga), bigeye (Thunnus obesus),
PART D.13 ■ Regional overview ■ Area 77: Eastern Central Pacific                                   267



yellowfin (Thunnus albacares) and skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis) tunas. The small pelagic
fleet employs purse seines and targets species such as Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax),
California anchovy (Engraulis mordax) and Pacific chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus).
Groundfish, including species like Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) and various rockfish
(Sebastes spp.), are primarily caught using trawl nets and longlines. Artisanal fleets are vital
for the livelihoods of coastal communities along the United States’ Pacific coast. These
fleets use a variety of fishing techniques – including gillnets, hand lines and traps – to
catch a wide range of species. Key species targeted by artisanal fishers include salmon,
Dungeness crab (Metacarcinus magister) and various species of flatfish.
   The regulatory framework for fisheries management in the Pacific waters of the United
States is established by the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management
Act. This law aims to prevent overfishing, rebuild overfished stocks, ensure conservation,
and facilitate long-term economic and social benefits. Key management measures include
catch limits, gear restrictions, closed seasons, and marine protected areas (MPAs). The
National Marine Fisheries Service and regional fishery management councils are respon-
sible for implementing these regulations.
2.2 Mexico
The fishing zones along Mexico’s Pacific coast are of great significance due to their vast
expanse and the diverse marine resources they harbour. This region spans approxi-
mately 7 828 km of coastline, stretching from the southern border of the United States
to the border between Mexico and Guatemala, and encompasses an EEZ of about
3.2 million km2 . Mexico has industrial fishing fleets as well as artisanal fleets, which use
smaller vessels to catch a wide variety of finfish and invertebrates.
   The industrial fleets in the Mexican Pacific primarily target tuna, small pelagics and
penaeid shrimp. The tuna fleet operates in the central and southern regions of the Gulf of
California, off the western coast of the Baja California peninsula, and in oceanic waters
within Mexico’s EEZ, using longlines and purse seines. The small pelagic fleet also employs
purse seines and mainly operates in the Gulf of California and along the western coast of
the Baja California peninsula. Key species caught include Pacific sardine, three species
of thread herring (Pacifc thread herring [Opisthonema libertate], slender thread herring
[Opisthonema bulleri] and middling thread herring [Opisthonema medirastre]), Pacific chub
mackerel and California anchovy. Shrimp capture is concentrated in the Gulf of California
and the Gulf of Tehuantepec, primarily using bottom trawl nets to catch species like blue
shrimp (Penaeus stylirostris), whiteleg shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) and yellowleg shrimp
(Penaeus californiensis).
   Artisanal fleets are essential for the livelihoods of communities along the Pacific coast
of Mexico. These fleets target a wide range of species using various fishing techniques that
vary by location. In the central Pacific region, artisanal fleets catch snappers (Lutjanidae)
and snook (Centropomus spp.) using handlines. Artisanal fishing of mojarras (Gerreidae)
and Pacific sierra (Scomberomorus sierra) is conducted in the central and southern Pacific
regions using gillnets and handlines. On the western coast of the Baja California penin-
sula, high-value fisheries, such as lobster, are carried out using traps, allowing for selective
harvesting and the implementation of sustainable practices. Other important fishery
resources along the Pacific coast of Mexico include groupers and snappers, which are
caught using gillnets, handlines, hooks and longlines. Crab (Callinectes spp.) is another
significant resource, mainly captured with traps in various regions including the Gulf of
California and the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Various clam species are also valuable resources,
especially in the Gulf of California and along the western coast of the Baja California
peninsula, where they are harvested through semi-autonomous diving.
   The regulatory framework and policy instruments governing fisheries management in
the Pacific waters of Mexico are established by the General Law of Sustainable Fisheries
and Aquaculture. This law is applied according to the specific needs of different resources,
aiming to achieve two primary goals: the sustainability of resource exploitation, and
conservation or recovery in case of any identified threat or degradation. The main instru-
ments include laws, official standards, and management plans. These give rise to various
measures such as regulated access, minimum catch sizes, controlled fishing gear and

                                2.3 Guatemala
                                Guatemala has approximately 402 km of coastline along the Pacific Ocean, and its EEZ in
                                this area covers 110 945 km², with a continental shelf of about 14 009 km² (López, 2022).
                                   Guatemala has a significant fishery sector, characterized by a blend of industrial and
                                artisanal fishing activities. The fisheries are divided into commercial, sport, scientific
                                and subsistence fishing, with commercial fishing further classified into tuna fishing,
                                large-scale, medium-scale, small-scale and artisanal fishing (Martínez et al., 2024). The
                                main fishing gears include longlines targeting dolphinfish and sharks, bottom gillnets
                                for demersal fish and shrimp, trawl nets for shrimp, and surface gillnets for fishing green
                                jack (Caranx caballus). Key management measures include the issuing of fishing licences
                                for medium- and large-scale fleets, as well as the regulation of fishing gear. The shrimp
                                trawl fleet is limited to 25 vessels to control fishing effort and capacity.
                                   Among the main fishery resources are common dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus),
                                silky shark (Carcharhinus falciformis), striped marlin (Kajikia audax), yellowfin tuna,
                                Indo-Pacific sailfish (Istiophorus platypterus), shrimp (whiteleg shrimp, blue shrimp,
                                Western white shrimp [Penaeus occidentalis], Pacific seabob [Xiphopenaeus riveti], crys-
                                tal shrimp [Penaeus brevirostris] and yellowleg shrimp), snappers (spotted rose snapper
                                [Lutjanus guttatus], Pacific red snapper [Lutjanus peru] and Colorado snapper [Lutjanus
                                colorado]), snooks “(black snook [Centropomus nigrescens] and white snook [Centropomus
                                viridis]), groupers, ronco (also known as raucous grunt, Haemulopsis leuciscus), croak-
                                ers (Cynoscion reticulatus), flounders (toothed flounder, Cyclopsetta querna) and catfish
                                (Arius spp.).
                                2.4 El Salvador
                                El Salvador has 321 km of coastline along the Pacific Ocean, extending from the Río
                                Paz to the Gulf of Fonseca. Its EEZ covers approximately 88 000 km², with a depth of
                                0–4 000 m, offering significant potential for fisheries. Fisheries are economically and
                                socially important in El Salvador, with many coastal communities relying heavily on
                                fishing for food security. The fleet of El Salvador operates in the coastal-marine area,
                                primarily supplying marine food for national consumption and export.
                                   Key species include shrimp, dolphinfish, snapper (Lutjanus spp.), Pacific sierra, croaker
                                (Sciaenidae), and green spiny lobster (Panulirus gracilis). The main fishing gears used
                                include gillnets, longlines, cast nets and handlines. Industrial shrimp trawling also plays
                                a crucial role, targeting species of the Penaeidae family, such as whiteleg, blue, Western
                                white, yellowleg, crystal and Pacific seabob shrimps. Tuna – highly migratory pelagic
                                fish – currently holding the highest recorded catch levels in national fisheries. Salvadoran
                                vessels use purse seines to catch tropical tuna species, including bigeye, yellowfin and
                                skipjack tunas.
                                   Fisheries management is governed by the General Law of Fisheries and Aquaculture
                                and its regulations, which aim to regulate and promote sustainable fishing and aquacul-
                                ture activities. Key management measures include regulated access, minimum catch sizes,
                                controlled fishing gear, closed seasons, quotas, and designated fishing zones. The law also
                                establishes an Aquatic Reserve Area, defined as a marine area extending one nautical mile
                                from the lowest tide line along the entire Salvadoran coast. Industrial fishing is prohib-
                                ited within three nautical miles of the coast, while artisanal fishers can operate starting
                                from the one mile limit.
                                2.5 Honduras
                                The capture fisheries on the Pacific coast of Honduras, particularly in the Gulf of Fonseca,
                                are primarily small-scale and artisanal. The Gulf of Fonseca is a strategic region, not
                                only because of its geographical location, but also because of the economic and trade
                                relations established in a cross-border area shared by Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua
                                (CETMAR, 2021). Despite its rich biodiversity, the region faces a number of social and

environmental problems, as it is one of the poorest and most vulnerable areas of the
country. Local fishing communities rely on a variety of traditional techniques, including
handlines, gillnets and cast nets. Honduras has a significant fishing industry focused on
both reef and pelagic species. Key target species include croakers, snappers, groupers, jacks,
and sea catfish. Shrimp fishing is also practised, mainly for domestic consumption and to
sell to intermediaries who distribute the catch in national markets.
   According to Honduran fishers, the decline and collapse of some fisheries was a result of
irresponsible fishing practices and habitat degradation from destructive fishing gear (Canty
et al., 2019). In addition, challenges in coordination among the three countries sharing
the Gulf hinders the implementation of comprehensive and sustainable fisheries policies,
exacerbating issues of poverty and vulnerability in the region (CETMAR, 2021). Over
time, awareness of the need for responsible fishing has grown, leading to initiatives aimed
at promoting sustainability, such as replacing illegal fishing gear and engaging in mangrove
reforestation projects. While industrial trawl fishing is not viable in this part of the Pacific
due to unsuitable conditions for trawling, artisanal fishers continue to play a vital role in
local economies, contributing to food security and livelihoods in coastal communities.
2.6. Nicaragua
The Pacific coast of Nicaragua is a vital area for both industrial and artisanal fisheries.
Industrial activities mainly focus on shrimp and finfish, with shrimp trawlers operating
extensively along the coast. Impoverished communities along Nicaragua’s Pacific coast
face worsening food insecurity and income challenges due to overfishing, mangrove loss,
rapid population growth and limited access to services and opportunities (Crawford
et al., 2010). Despite some declines in landings over time, shrimp fishing remains an
important part of the industry. Additionally, various fish species, such as snapper and
grouper, are caught in both industrial and artisanal fisheries. Artisanal fishing is especially
significant, making up a large portion of marine production. Fishers primarily use small
boats like fiberglass pangas with outboard motors and employ methods such as gillnets
and handlines. Key fishing centres along the coast, like Potosí, Mechapa, and Corinto,
contribute to the sector’s output. While infrastructure remains limited in some areas,
the Pacific fisheries are essential to Nicaragua’s economy, providing employment and
supporting exports, with ongoing efforts toward sustainability and resource management.
   The main fishery resources in the Pacific were shrimp (both coastal and deep-sea),
which accounted for 1.7 percent of marine landings, and finfishes, which represented
17.5 percent of total marine production. Aquaculture, particularly shrimp farming,
played a dominant role, contributing 77.9 percent of the Pacific’s total production. Despite
challenges such as the impact of hurricanes in 2020, the sector demonstrated resilience,
with investments in infrastructure, machinery, and equipment supporting its recovery
and growth. Overall, the fisheries and aquaculture sector remained a vital component of
Nicaragua’s economy, contributing to food security, employment, and export earnings
(INPESCA, 2021).
2.7 Costa Rica
The fisheries along Costa Rica’s Pacific coast are significant due to their extensive range
and the diverse marine resources they encompass. This region spans from the border with
Nicaragua to the border with Panama, including an EEZ of approximately 574 725 km2.
Costa Rica has both industrial and artisanal fishing fleets, targeting a wide variety of species.
   The industrial fleets in Costa Rica’s Pacific EEZ primarily target large and small pelagic
species. The large pelagic fleet uses longlines and purse seines to capture species such as
yellowfin tuna,common dolphinfish (also known as mahi-mahi, Coryphaena hippurus)
and swordfish (Xiphias gladius). The small pelagic fleet employs purse seines and targets
species like Pacific sardine and anchovy species. Artisanal fleets are vital for the liveli-
hoods of coastal communities along Costa Rica’s Pacific coast. These fleets use a variety
of fishing techniques, including gillnets, handlines and traps, to catch a wide range of
species. Key species targeted by artisanal fishers include snapper (Lutjanidae), snook and
various shrimp and crab species.

                                   The regulatory framework for fisheries management in Costa Rica’s Pacific is estab-
                                lished by the Fisheries and Aquaculture Law. This law aims to prevent overfishing, rebuild

                                fits. Key management measures include catch limits, gear restrictions, closed seasons,
                                and MPAs. The Costa Rican Institute of Fisheries and Aquaculture (INCOPESCA)
                                is responsible for implementing these regulations. Costa Rica emphasizes sustainable
                                fishing practices, with a significant focus on responsible management of its fish stocks.
                                2.8 Panama
                                The fisheries sector in Panama plays a vital role in food supply and food security, particu-
                                larly in coastal areas and remote regions. For many coastal communities, fishing is the
                                primary livelihood.
                                   The structure of Panama’s fishing industry is diverse, ranging from small-scale arti-
                                sanal boats to large industrial vessels. Panama serves as a vital transit point for fisheries,
                                with significant small-pelagic fisheries operating in its waters. The industrial fishing fleet
                                consists of shrimp trawlers, purse seiners, and longliners. Longliners primarily target
                                species like snapper, grouper, shark, common dophinfish (also known as mahi-mahi), and
                                tuna. The longline fleet has recently diversified, focusing on common dolphinfish and
                                tuna, with semi-industrial longliners targeting snapper, grouper, and shark. Herring and
                                anchovy fishing is conducted by purse seiners. Shrimp trawling primarily targets Northern
                                white shrimp (Penaeus setiferus). Artisanal fishing takes place throughout Panama’s
                                waters. Most artisanal vessels are small, under 10 gross tonnes. Subsistence fishing still
                                exists in marginalized areas, mainly in regions with Indigenous communities. While
                                little data is available, many traditional subsistence fishers have transitioned to full-time
                                or occasional commercial artisanal fishing. Panama is also a renowned destination for
                                sport fishing, particularly for billfish species.

3.2 Classification of the status of stocks
Overall, of the 91 assessed stocks for Area 77, 69.2 percent are sustainably fished while
30.8 percent are unsustainably fished. More specifically, 36.3 percent are considered
underfished, 33 percent are considered maximally sustainably fished, and 30.8 percent
are considered overfished (TABLE D.13.2). When weighted by their production levels,
biollogically sustainable stocks account for 81.2 percent of the 2021 landings of assessed
stocks monitored by FAO (TABLE D.13.3).

   Under the updated methodology (PART B, METHODOLOGY, pp. 6), stocks were divided
into three tiers to determine their state of exploitation. A total of 47 stocks representing
34 species were included under Tier 1 (TABLE D.13.1). The stock status information for
these stocks was extracted from available national and regional stock assessment reports.
A total of 43 stocks representing 34 species were identified for Tier 2, all of which were
considered non-straddling and thus to only occur within the jurisdictional waters of the
reporting countries. The stock status information was extracted from available assessment
reports or obtained through model runs using catch and effort data when available. Only
one stock (Dungeness crab) was considered in Tier 3.

                                            4. KEY SELECTED STOCKS AND SPECIES
Eastern Central Pacific




                                            This section identifies and discusses species and stocks that are currently most important
                                            for Area 77 (FIGURE D.13.2), including their description, available data, catch trends and
                                            current status.
                                            4.1 Cods (hakes and haddocks)
                                            In Area 77, cods are a monospecific group consisting only of North Pacific hake (Merluccius
                                            productus). In 2021, hake landings were 297 000 tonnes throughout its coastal range, of
                                            which about 7 400 tonnes were caught in Area 77. North Pacific hake consists of four
                                            stocks spread across Area 77 and Area 67, with the North Central Pacific hake being the
                                            only stock in Area 77 (ranging from northern California to northern British Columbia).
                                            The species’ distribution extends beyond the boundaries of Area 77 (e.g. to the Strait of
                                            Georgia and Puget Sound), but of the fleets that exploit it, only the Northern California
                                            fleet operates within Area 77.
                                               Each year, the United States and Canada use separate fishery statistics, disaggregated
                                            by fleet, to determine both the status of the portion of the stock harvested in Areas 67
                                            and 77, as well as corresponding management measures. The information used to assess
                                            the stock as a whole includes biomass time series, fishing mortality estimates and catches
                                            (Edwards et al., 2022). About 25 percent of the total catch comes from Area 77. The FSB in
                                            2022 was 40 percent below the reference point. The stock is maximally sustainably fished.

                                            The resources of miscellaneous coastal fish mainly comprise species that are highly
                                            valued and thus possess significant commercial worth. Among these are the croak-
                                            ers, which include various species from the Sciaenidae family, particularly weakfishes
                                            (Cynoscion spp.) and croakers (Micropogonias spp.); the Northern red snapper (Lutjanus
                                            campechanus) and various other snapper species, primarily from the Lutjanidae family,
                                            especially within the genus Lutjanus spp.; as well as several species of groupers and rock
                                            snappers from the Serranidae family; mojarras from the Gerreidae family; and snooks
                                            from the Centropomidae family. These species are caught using various fishing gears by
                                            small-scale fleets, and in most cases there is very little recorded information available to

conduct assessments of their exploitation status. In most of Area 77, independent biolog-
ical stocks are not identified, and as such, it is assumed that a continuous distribution
of a particular species exists along the Central Pacific coast. In certain countries within
the region, such as Mexico, the United States, Panama and Costa Rica, some fishing
stocks corresponding to specific regions have been identified, and where there is recorded
information on fisheries, the status of their exploitation is presented. The aforementioned
fish families have contributed an average of 52 000 tonnes annually over the past ten years,
while the total ISSCAAP 33 group averages 66 000 tonnes annually. Overall, stocks of
groupers and snappers in Central America range from overfished to maximally sustainably
fished. As a whole, this group is not doing as well as the other species groupings in the Area.
4.3 Miscellaneous demersal fishes
Miscellaneous demersal fishes, also referred to as benthic fishes, are typically associated with
marine bottoms, whether muddy, rocky or reef-like. Typical species include members of the
family Sebastidae (Sebastes spp.), commonly known as rockfish; various families of flatfish
such as Soleidae, Paralychthidae and Bothidae; cod species from the family Gadiidae (Gadus
spp.); as well as other species such as morays (Muraenesocidae, Cynoponticus spp.), scorpi-
onfish from the Scorpaenidae family (Scorpaena spp.), and brotulas, Trhichiuridae, among
others. Given the variety of species, various gears and fishing methods are employed for their
capture, including bottom trawls, pots and traps, bottom longlines and gill nets. Minimum
size limits are defined, and in some regions controlled areas and escape devices are in place.
In terms of fishing regulation, quotas, minimum size limits and designated closed areas
and seasons are enforced, along with regulations on fishing gear, while monitoring and
surveillance activities are conducted in some regions. According to available assessments
in the United States, the California blue and deacon complex (Sebastes mystinus/Sebastes
diaconus), sunset rockfish (Sebastes miniatus/Sebastes crocotulus), black rockfish (Sebastes
melanops), blackgill rockfish (Sebastes melanostomus) and bocaccio (Sebastes paucispinis)
were all maximally sustainably fished. The chilipepper rockfish (Sebastes goodei), cowcod
(Sebastes levis), gopher and black-and-yellow rockfish complex (Sebastes carnatus/Sebastes
chrysomelas), the shortbelly rockfish (Sebastes jordani), stripetail rockfish (Sebastes saxicola)
and longspine thornyhead (Sebastolobus altivelis) were diagnosed as underfished. The
California scorpionfish (Scorpaena guttata) is underfished. In Costa Rica, the stock of
red pike conger (Cynoponticus coniceps) was assessed as underfished. Stocks of sablefish,
belonging to the family Trichiuridae, are assessed as overfished in Area 77.
4.4 Herrings, sardines and anchovies
Small pelagics are the most productive fish group in Area 77 in terms of landings, reaching
roughly 1 million tonnes in 2021, of which more than half comprised Pacific sardine
(Sardinops sagax) and California anchovy (Engraulis mordax) (Kuriyama et al., 2022a,
2022b; INAPESCA, 2022). The group consists of ten species whose stocks are distributed
from northern California to Panama, but the largest biomasses are concentrated along the
Californias, including the west coast of the Baja peninsula and the Gulf of California. It
has been shown that fluctuations in the abundance of these stocks are largely determined
by the variability of oceanographic conditions, but virtually all are fished at their maxi-
mum productivity levels. They are also the best-monitored group of fishes within Area 77
(annual biomass surveys, size/age structure and recruitment levels), and their management
is based on quantitative methods and high-quality data (PFMC, 2020). The following is
a summary of the species that constitutes the small pelagics group in Area 77. The central
stock of northern anchovy is assessed as maximally sustainably fished, while the Gulf of
California is overfished. Two stocks of Pacific sardine (Gulf of California and Southern
stocks) were assessed as maximally sustainably fished. The Pacific thread herring complex
in Mexico and in Panama, including species of slender thread herring (Opisthonema
bulleri), Pacific thread herring (Opisthonema libertate) and middling thread herring
(Opisthonema medirastre), are assessed as maximally sustainably fished. The stocks of
Pacific anchoveta (Cetengraulis mysticetus) in the Gulf of California and Gulf of Panama
are assessed as maximally sustainably fished (INAPESCA, 2022; Canales, 2020).

                                4.5 Flounders, halibuts and soles
Eastern Central Pacific




                                The toothed flounder (Cyclopsetta querna) is a demersal species that inhabits the soft-bot-
                                tom areas of the continental shelf in the Guatemalan Pacific, primarily between 25 m to
                                30 m in depth. Although it is not a target species for commercial fisheries, its incidental
                                capture in shrimp trawl nets has increased in recent years, with an average annual catch
                                of 94 tonnes over the past ten years (González Bolaños, 2015; Ixquiac, 2010). The main
                                fishing grounds for flounder are located between Puerto San José and the border with
                                El Salvador. These areas are associated with high biological diversity zones and feature
                                water temperatures between 26 °C to 28 °C, which are optimal conditions for this species
                                (Flores-Ortega et al., 2013).
                                   The biomass of flounder on the Guatemalan Pacific shelf is estimated at around
                                827 tonnes, with historical values ranging up to 1 033 tonnes. Assessments indicate
                                that the species is in a maximally sustainably fished state (Bianchi, 1991; Ixquiac, 2010).
                                Evaluations based on the swept-area method suggest that flounder abundance is maxi-
                                mized at depths of 25–30 m, with stable dynamic biomass over the years supporting its
                                classification as maximally sustainably fished (González, 2015).
                                4.6 Miscellaneous pelagic fishes
                                Pacific chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus) and Pacific jack mackerel (Trachurus symme-
                                tricus) are among the main species of miscellaneous pelagics in Area 77. These stocks are
                                distributed from Canada to the Gulf of California and together contributed more than
                                40 700 tonnes of catches in 2021 (Kuriyama et al., 2023). As these stocks are caught by
                                the small pelagic fisheries in Mexico and the United States, they are also monitored and
                                managed by harvest control rules, but they are not as actively managed as other stocks of
                                small pelagics. The assessments of the Central California and Gulf of California stocks
                                of Pacific chub mackerel indicate that stocks are maximally sustainably fished. The stock
                                of Pacific jack mackerel exploited by the Pacific sardine fishery is considered underfished.
                                   The common dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus) is also a pelagic species of signifi-
                                cant commercial importance, particularly within the EEZ of Guatemala. This species
                                is caught seasonally by both artisanal and industrial fleets, primarily through the use of
                                longlines. Catches have shown a significant decline in recent years. Studies have shown
                                that 50 percent of females and males are caught at sizes below 75 and 85 cm, respectively,
                                indicating unsustainable exploitation of the resource (López, 2010).
                                4.7 Sharks, rays and chimaeras
                                In Area 77, several species of commercially important sharks have been identified. Among
                                the most notable are the hammerhead shark (Sphyrna spp.), silky shark (Carcharhinus
                                falciformis), blue shark (Prionace glauca), shortfin mako shark (Isurus oxyrinchus) and
                                thresher shark (Alopias spp.). Regarding rays, there are several species of commercial
                                importance in the region, including the whipray (Dasyatis longa), Pacific whipray (also
                                known as diamond stingray, Hypanus dipterurus), California butterfly ray (Gymnura
                                marmorata) and spotted eagle ray (Aetobatus narinari), among others. With regards to
                                chimaeras, also known as ghost sharks, the most significant species are the shortnose
                                chimaera (also known as spotted ratfish, Hydrolagus colliei), black chimaera (also known
                                as the East Pacific black goatshark, Hydrolagus melanophasma) and ghost chimaera (also
                                known as silver chimaera, Chimaera phantasma).
                                   Several species are subject to special protection. The fishing of sharks, rays and chimae-
                                ras occurs along the coast of Area 77, with a heterogeneous distribution, although for
                                some species movement patterns are well understood. Among the primary management
                                measures are restrictions on fishing, minimum size limits, the frequent implementation of
                                training programmes for fishers, and monitoring. The most commonly employed fishing
                                gears include surface longlines, gill nets, pots and harpoons. These species provide suste-
                                nance for coastal communities and are considered an important source of employment
                                and family livelihoods. In the case of sharks, they are typically long-lived and have low
PART D.13 ■ Regional overview ■ Area 77: Eastern Central Pacific                                275




fecundity, making them vulnerable to overfishing; hence, several species are classified as
threatened or endangered.
    In Guatemala, the scalloped hammerhead shark (Sphyrna lewini) is considered under-
fished, with low catches compared to other shark species. However, due to the pressure on
neonates and juveniles, as well as the growing demand for shark products, the species faces
significant threats. Annual landings of silky sharks are estimated at around 220 tonnes,
with an average of 234 tonnes over the past five years, although the sizes of captured indi-
viduals continue to show a declining trend (CONAP, 2023).
    The big skate (Beringraja binoculata, also known as the giant skate) fishery in Southern
California primarily occurs in coastal and demersal waters. This is the largest skate
species in the North American Pacific Ocean, found from Alaska to Baja California. In
California, regulations aim to protect the big skate, including catch limits and seasonal
closures to manage the population. The assessment performed indicates that this stock
is currently underfished.
4.8 Crabs and sea-spiders
Crabs are a fishery resource found along the coastline of Area 77, closely linked to lagoon
systems, estuaries, bays and adjacent marine regions. They are economically and socially
important species for coastal communities, providing employment and family sustenance.
The crabs correspond to different species of Callinectes swimcrabs (Callinectes spp.),
which are primarily targeted by coastal fishing, employing various types of fishing gear,
including fixed traps (pots or traps) or manually operated nets such as baskets, gill nets
or hand-capture techniques. These species are relatively accessible, and the dispersion of
both the resource and the fishing fleets does not allow for continuous record-keeping that
would provide accurate assessments of their exploitation status.
   One of the few evaluations along Mexico’s coastline focuses on the brown crab (also
known as warrior swimcrab, Callinectes bellicosus) in the Upper Gulf of California.
Regulations generally focus on minimum catch sizes and area closures to protect repro-
duction. The stock is assessed as underfished. The Dungeness crab (Cancer magister)
in Area 77 is a resource of commercial importance and is also targeted by recreational
fishers, primarily in the central-southern region of California, notably in Monterey Bay
and Orange County. Fishing is primarily conducted using pots and hand collectors.
The regulation of the fishery is mainly based on catch limits, minimum size restrictions,
a fishing season and fishing permits, which may vary by region. Both commercial and
recreational fishing establish catch limits that can differ according to the area. Recent
commercial catches have averaged around 6 000 tonnes annually. The stock is maximally
sustainably fished.
4.9 Lobsters and spiny rock lobsters
The lobster resource (Panulirus spp.) is highly valued for its economic importance along
the coastal region of the Eastern Central Pacific. The primary target species for fish-
ing include the Mexican spiny lobster (Panulirus interruptus), the green spiny lobster
(Panulirus gracilis), the blue spiny lobster (Panulirus inflatus) and Revillagigedo lobster
(also known as pronghorn spiny lobster, Panulirus penicillatus), as well as occasionally
species from the family Scyllaridae. Fishing is conducted using various methods that
vary by region, including diving, traps, nets and hand collection. Regulation is based on
fishing seasons, minimum catch sizes and protected areas; in some regions, monitoring
and surveillance are also maintained. The seafood products are sold either whole or as tails,
and can be fresh or frozen; the majority are sold live. Pre-cooked lobster is less common.
Overall, there is limited information available for stock assessment studies to support
management measures. Most of the catch is achieved through small-scale fisheries, with

                                industrial fishing being infrequent. The assessment of the Mexican spiny lobster along
Eastern Central Pacific




                                the Pacific coast of Mexico, particularly in the Baja California peninsula, indicates that
                                the stock is maximally sustainably fished.
                                4.10 Shrimps and prawns
                                Shrimp fisheries in Area 77 are arguably the most economically and socially significant
                                for several countries in the region, and they represent an important fraction of the gross
                                domestic product (GDP) in Mexico. Their capture occurs at different life stages, consti-
                                tuting a typical sequential fishery, with juveniles in inner coastal waters and estuaries,
                                pre-adults in the coastal zone, and adults in marine areas. Catches in coastal and inland
                                waters are made using various fishing methods, including different types of nets and
                                even traps. In the ocean, shrimp vessels typically operate using trawl nets. The regulation
                                of fishing varies by region and generally consists of temporary closures, catch limits,
                                regulations on fishing fleets and fishing techniques, and minimum size limits according
                                to the fishery and the gear employed. The most important species include the y ellowleg
                                shrimp (Penaeus californiensis), blue shrimp (Penaeus stylirostris), crystal shrimp (Penaeus
                                brevirostris), whiteleg shrimp (Penaeus vannamei), and the botalón shrimp or Pacific
                                seabob shrimp (Xiphopenaeus riveti), among others. These species are distributed along
                                the coast of Area 77 with heterogeneous distribution, with some regions being more
                                productive than others; the Gulf of California is considered the most productive area.
                                   The main shrimp stocks of brown, blue and white shrimp in the Mexican Pacific are
                                all maximally sustainably fished. Other stocks of these species in Central America are
                                mainly overfished with some maximally sustainably fished, although it is important to
                                note that the uncertainty on these estimates is high.
                                4.11 Scallops and pectens
                                Scallops or pectens are bivalve species belonging to the family Pectinidae. Some of the
                                most important species include the Pacific calico scallop (Argopecten ventricosus) and
                                Pacific lion’s paw (Nodipecten subnodosus), among others. Catches are primarily made
                                through hand collection and diving. Key management practices consider catch quotas,
                                minimum sizes and protected areas. Since clam beds are distributed by regions according
                                to suitable habitats, the benefits of fishing primarily accrue to local inhabitants, either
                                through extraction activities or in processing plants when products are exported. The
                                commercial capture of scallops is still at an early stage in Central America, with the
                                Gulf of California and the Pacific coast of the Baja California peninsula being the most
                                developed regions.
                                   The fishery for the Pacific calico scallop, also known as the Pacific calico clam, is an
                                important economic activity in Mexico, particularly in the region of Baja California Sur.
                                This species is found along the Pacific coast from Santa Barbara, California, to Piura, Peru,
                                with a distinct fishery developing in the southern region of the Baja California peninsula.
                                At its peak in 1990, over 29 000 tonnes were harvested. Currently, this fishery provides
                                employment to approximately 3 000 families through the commercialization of the
                                scallop’s meat. Management measures include seasonal closures to protect reproductive
                                periods, along with limits on the quantity and size of scallops that can be harvested. The
                                resource is considered underfished.
                                4.12 Clams, cockles and arkshells
                                Clam fisheries in Area 77 hold significant importance in certain regions, both for their
                                economic value and as a crucial source of employment. Among the most prized clams are
                                those belonging to the family Veneridae, such as the chocolata clam (also known as squalid
                                callista, Megapitaria squalida), the white clam (also known as ponderous dosinia, Dosinia
                                ponderosa), and the Pismo clam (Tivela stultorum); as well as the Pacific geoduck clam
                                (Panopea generosa) from the family Hiatellidae, and several species of the genus Chione,

among others. Generally, these fisheries are considered to be in a developmental phase,
although the exploitation status of the stocks varies by region. Management measures
include defining fishing seasons, setting quotas, establishing protected areas, requiring
fishing permits and enforcing minimum size limits. Fisheries are conducted in shallow
waters close to the shore, depending on the species. Among the greatest challenges are
the risk of overfishing due to easy access, climate change, pollution, and the lack of scien-
tific information and monitoring that would facilitate the implementation of effective
management measures. These fisheries are relevant from a social perspective, providing
jobs and sustaining families and communities.
   The fishery for the chocolata clam is one of the most significant in Baja California Sur,
Mexico. The fishery is concentrated primarily in six regions: Bahía de La Paz, Laguna
Ojo de Liebre, Bahía Magdalena, Laguna San Ignacio, Bahía de Loreto, and the Costa de
Santa Rosalía, with the first three regions representing just over 95 percent of total catches.
Historically, there was a significant increase in production from 1992 (315 tonnes) to 2002
(1 128 tonnes), primarily associated with increases in Laguna Ojo de Liebre and Bahía
de La Paz. After 2002, a general decline in catches was observed. In Bahía Magdalena,
catches decreased significantly from 457 tonnes in 2001 to 73 tonnes in 2006. It has been
considered that in regions such as Bahía de La Paz, the resource is being exploited at its
maximum biological production capacity, though more detailed studies are recommended
due to the risk of it being overfished.
4.13 Miscellaneous aquatic invertebrates
The cannonball jellyfish (Stomolophus spp.) fisheries are developed in the central-northern
region of the western Gulf of California. These are recent fisheries that began around the
year 2000 as development fisheries and transitioned to commercial fisheries in 2010. The
species is typically captured at the mouths of estuaries and within 30 m of beaches. The
product for consumers represents approximately 10 percent of the live weight volume,
while its value is generally high, with exports primarily directed to Asian countries.
The management of the fishery is regulated through fishing permits, a minimum size
requirement, and a minimum mesh size in the scoop net used for capture. There is limited
scientific knowledge about the resource, and official fishing statistics are still at an early
stage; however, fishing organizations maintain catch records. The analysis of the fishery
status was conducted considering annual catch and effort data for the blue and amber
cannonball jellyfish. It was concluded that the resource is maximally sustainably fished.

5. KEY FINDINGS
Across all 91 stocks assessed in Area 77, 30.8 percent were considered overfished,
33 percent maximally sustainably fished, and 36.3 percent underfished. Comparisons of
results obtained from the previous assessments and the updated approach show significant
differences, with the proportion of overfished stocks being twice as high in the updated
approach; this is even more apparent when weighted by landings (TABLES D.13.4 and D.13.5).
Given that this region had poor coverage of information in the past, many smaller assess-
ment units and species were added in this updated assessment, resulting in an estimate
that is worse than if landings information alone had been used. Indeed, the number of
assessed stocks grew from 19 to 91 units that are now regularly assessed. In addition, the
coverage of 86.6 percent of landings has increased in comparison with 74.2 percent of
landings assessed with the previous methodology in 2021.
   Specifically, this change may be a result of the inclusion of an additional number of
Tier 2 stocks, which are mostly from small-scale fisheries with high uncertainty in their
data. About 47.2 percent of stocks assessed under the new approach were Tier 2. The
percentage of Tier 2 stocks that were overfished (44.2 percent) was more than double
that of Tier 1 stocks (19.1 percent) (TABLE D.13.2), in line with the trend that stocks

                                with better monitoring and assessment tend to be in better condition. Notably, several
Eastern Central Pacific




                                overfished stocks include coastal resources of high socioeconomic importance, such as
                                groupers, snappers and shrimps. Strengthening management and monitoring efforts for
                                these fisheries will be essential to ensuring their long-term sustainability and the liveli-
                                hoods they support.

                                  To conclude, despite an increased percentage of overfished stocks under this new meth-
                                odology, the proportion of stocks which are sustainably fished in Area 77 remains above
                                the global average. Strengthening management systems in Central America would be a
                                useful step towards ensuring that the resource base remains or gets closer to high sustain-
                                ability levels in the future.

  A large proportion of landings in this region is comprised of small
   and short lived pelagic species whose abundance varies greatly with
   environmental changes.
  The percentage of sustainable stocks in Area 77 is amongst the highest
   of any FAO Area, although overfishing and climate change threaten some
   high-value coastal resources such as groupers, snappers and shrimps.
  There are valuable commercial fisheries for tunas and swordfish.
  There are important recreational fisheries, especially around Hawaii,
   which is also one of the world’s largest marine protected area.

1. OVERVIEW
The Southwest Pacific, designated by FAO as Major Fishing Area 81 (hereafter, Area 81),
encompasses the Tasman Sea and the Pacific Ocean from 150° to 120° east. It includes
the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of New Zealand and a part of Australia (the state
of New South Wales), as well as extensive areas of the high seas. The total surface area is
27.7 million km2 , with only 0.4 million km2 of shelf area. It is delimited in the west by the
eastern limit of FAO Area 57, in the south by FAO Area 88, in the east by FAO Area 87,
and in the north by FAO Areas 71 and 77 (FIGURE D.14.1).
   Australia and New Zealand are linked by the East Australian Current (EAC). It flows
south along the east coast of Australia but becomes weaker and diffused south of Sydney.

                          Part of this current system turns east to form the Tasman Front, flows across northern
                          New Zealand, then down the east coast of the North Island where it becomes known
Southwest Pacific




                          as the East Cape Current. An extension to the EAC flows further south until it comes
                          into contact with the northern edges of the Southern Ocean at the southern margin
                          of the Tasman Sea. The Subtropical Convergence forms where the Tasman Sea meets
                          the Southern Ocean, across the Tasman Sea and around the southern part of the South
                          Island of New Zealand, flowing north up the east coast to Chatham Rise (an oceanic rise
                          extending to beyond the Chatham Islands), where it meets the East Cape Current and
                          turns east. Areas of high fisheries productivity occur where the Subtropical Convergence
                          forms around New Zealand.
                             The Southwest Pacific is among the smallest areas globally in terms of landings.
                          Nonetheless, the fisheries in Area 81 are diverse with both small-scale and industrial-scale
                          fishing operations covering estuarine, coastal and continental shelf fisheries, as well as
                          oceanic fisheries. A range of different fishing methods and gears are used. Management
                          systems in the jurisdictions of New Zealand, Australia and the high seas are well devel-
                          oped, including catch reporting and assessment systems. The fisheries resources consist
                          of the coastal species of the Australian state of New South Wales (with very small areas of
                          Northern Victoria and offshore Tasmania), and of New Zealand, the pelagic resources of
                          the Southwest Pacific, and mesopelagic species. Species compositions of declared landings
                          have remained relatively stable over the FAO time series observed.
                             It is worth noting that the data and information presented in this Chapter not only
                          comes from FAO, but also from Fisheries New Zealand (2024) and Australian Status of

                          2. FISHERY PROFILES
                          The fisheries in Area 81 can be organized into three subregions based on jurisdictions,
                          habitats and types of species generally targeted: the Australian New South Wales (NSW)
                          EEZ, the New Zealand EEZ, and the high seas. The latter incorporates the large expanse
                          of open ocean in Area 81 and contains distinct fisheries and resources.
                             Historically, reported landings for Area 81 increased sharply during the 1970s and
                          1980s, peaking at around 929 000 tonnes in the early 1990s. Landings have steadily
                          declined since then, largely due to a reduction in catch limits to ensure sustainability; in
                          2021 they were at around 388 000 tonnes (FIGURE D.14.2). Landings in this Area contain
                          many different species, with blue grenadier (Macruronus novaezelandiae), horse mackerels
                          (Trachurus spp.) and Wellington flying squid (Nototodarus sloanii) representing the major
                          species reported, respectfully accounting for 26 percent, 12 percent and 8 percent of the
                          total reported catch. Snoek (Leionura atun) and southern blue whiting (Micromesistius
                          australis) were also key species in the Area, representing 6 percent and 5 percent of the total
                          reported catch. Approximately 7 percent of the total catch are oceanic high seas species.
                             Six different countries reported catch for Area 81 in 2021, with the vast major-
                          ity reported by New Zealand (88 percent), followed by Australia (7.5 percent), Spain
                          (1.3 percent), Japan (1.2 percent), Taiwan Province of China (1.2 percent), China (about
                          1 percent), and a negligible catch from Pitcairn Island.
                          2.1 Australian New South Wales EEZ
                          The waters of NSW include about 8 802 km2 of estuary and ocean, over 1 750 km of ocean
                          coastline, 44 offshore islands, and 185 estuaries and coastal lakes. The NSW continental
                          shelf is generally less than 50 km and is only 53 km at its widest point (Whitehouse, 2007);
                          as such, most of this region is characterized by deep waters. The marine habitats support-
                          ing fisheries in NSW comprise a multitude of shallow and deep rocky reefs, nearshore and
                          offshore islands, sandy and muddy substrate areas, and a mosaic of corals, sea urchins, kelp
                          and mixed algal assemblages. An increasing tropical influence in habitats and organisms is
                          seen on the northern part of the coast (Jordan et al., 2010; GeoScience Australia, 2014).

The poleward-flowing EAC has a significant influence in modulating the region’s climate
as well as the composition, organization and function of marine ecosystems; it brings
warm water down the NSW coast and the eddy field it produces dominates the marine
environment on the narrow continental shelf.
   In Australia, marine fisheries management responsibilities are spread across multiple
jurisdictions: the Commonwealth, states and the Northern Territory. The Commonwealth
manages commercial fisheries within the Australian Fishing Zone, which generally
extends from three to 200 nautical miles off the coast. It also manages the activities of
Australian-flagged fishing vessels operating on the high seas. This responsibility lies with
the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA), which coordinates inter-
national cooperation on straddling and highly migratory fish stocks through regional
fisheries management organizations (RFMOs). State governments have the responsibil-
ity of administering Australia’s fisheries within three nautical miles of the coastline. In
NSW, this responsibility lies with the NSW Department of Primary Industries.
   Australia’s reported landings for Area 81 come from a diverse range of small-scale and
semi-industrial fisheries targeting a range of species in different habitats, primarily in
estuarine, coastal and continental shelf waters, but also on the continental slope. In 2021,
a total of 29 178 tonnes was reported, dominated by blue mackerel (Scomber australat-
icus) and greenback horse mackerel (Trachurus declivis). Together, these two species
made up around 51 percent of total reported landings. Other species of importance for
this region were mullets (8.9 percent), eastern school shrimp (Metapenaeus macleayi)
(3.6 percent), southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii) (3.5 percent), sillago (3.3 percent),
flathead (3.2 percent) and Australian salmon (Arripis trutta) (3.2 percent). Approximately
8 percent of the total catch reported by Australia in Area 81 is comprised of oceanic species
targeted by industrial tuna vessels in the high seas. In addition, approximately 25 percent
of the total catch reported by Australia in Area 81 is reported as species groupings.
   The state-managed fisheries include the abalone fishery that uses hand collection meth-
ods to target blacklip abalone (Haliotis rubra), the estuary general fishery (a multi-species,
multi-gear fishery operating within NSW estuarine systems), and the estuary prawn
trawl fishery. In addition, a lobster fishery is also present which uses beehive/square traps
and rectangular traps to target green rock lobster (Sagmariasus verreauxi). The ocean
hauling fishery in this region uses haul nets off beaches and purse-seine nets in deeper
water offshore targeting schooling species including Pacific sardines (Sardinops sagax),
flathead grey mullet (Mugil cephalus), Australian salmon, blue mackerel, yellowtail
horse mackerel (Trachurus novaezelandiae) and surf bream (Acanthopagrus australis).
Moreover, the ocean trap and line fishery (OTLF) operates along the entire NSW coast
in both continental shelf and continental slope waters and uses traps and hook-and-
line gear to target mainly silver seabream (Chrysophrys auratus), yellowtail amberjack
(Seriola lalandi), leatherjacket (Oligoplites saurus), bullet tuna (Auxis rochei) and silver
trevally (Pseudocaranx georgianus). The ocean trawl fishery also operates in continental
shelf and continental slope waters, and uses otter and Danish seine trawl nets to target
a range of species, including prawns, shrimps, octopus, cuttlefish, squid, Japanese fan
lobsters (Ibacus ciliatus), and several fish and shark species. Finally, the sea urchin and
green turban shell (Turbo marmoratus) restricted fishery operates using hookah and hand
collection methods.
   The Commonwealth fisheries operate within the Australian Fishing Zone off the NSW
coast and often span multiple state jurisdictions. These include the small pelagic fishery,
which covers the entire NSW coastline (typically outside three nautical miles) and uses
mid-water trawl and purse-seine methods to target a range of small pelagic species (minor
line fishing and squid jigging are also permitted). It also encompasses the southern and
eastern scalefish and shark fishery (SESSF) which is a multi-sector, multi-species fishery
that uses many different gear types to target species that include blue grenadier, tiger
flathead (Platycephalus richardsoni), common warehou (Seriolella brama), gummy shark
(Mustelus antarcticus), pink cusk-eel (Genypterus blacodes), and Flinders’ sillago (Sillago
flindersi). Moreover, the eastern tuna and billfish fishery is also present and mainly uses

                          (Kajikia audax). As these are all straddling stocks taken by a number of other countries,
                          they are managed through the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission. The
                          southern bluefin tuna fishery uses pelagic longline and purse-seine gear; most fish caught
                          using the latter are transferred to aquaculture farms for grow-out before final harvest.
                          There is also a southern squid jig fishery, a single-method, single-species fishery targeting
                          Gould’s flying squid (Nototodarus gouldi). Lastly, the Macquarie Island toothfish fishery
                          only operates in the Australian waters surrounding the island, located in sub-Antarctic
                          waters in the southwestern region of Area 81, and mainly uses longline gear (demersal or
                          bottom longline) to catch Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides).
                             Indigenous fisheries are important in the NSW EEZ, representing a critical source of
                          social cohesion, kinship connection and communal life for Aboriginal peoples. This is
                          recognized through legislation such as the Native Title Act 1993 (Cth) and the Native
                          Title (NSW) Act 1994. These allow Aboriginal title-holders to exercise their rights to fish
                          for personal, domestic or non-commercial needs and are not affected by NSW fisheries
                          management legislation (NSW Government, n.d.).
                             Recreational fishing is also extremely important in NSW waters for social and
                          economic benefits, with more than 1 million anglers per year generating approximately
                          USD 3.4 billion of economic activity (Murphy et al., 2022). The sector targets simi-
                          lar species to the commercial fishing sector, in particular seabream, dusky flathead
                          (Platycephalus fuscus) and sillago species.
                          2.2 New Zealand EEZ
                          New Zealand has a coastline of approximately 15 000 km and an EEZ of over
                          4 083 000 km2: this is the fifth-largest EEZ in the world, and covers 30 degrees of latitude.
                          There is a sizable continental shelf available to coastal fisheries. Larger vessels have access
                          to offshore continental rises, the most important being Chatham Rise which runs east
                          from the South Island to beyond the Chatham Islands. Together these fishable grounds
                          occupy about 30 percent of the area of the EEZ. Marine habitats supporting fisheries
                          comprise shallow and deep rocky reefs, nearshore and offshore islands, sandy and muddy
                          substrate areas, mangroves and coastal harbours, and deep-sea habitats including both
                          flat grounds and underwater ridges, pinnacles and hills. In addition, the mixing of waters
                          in the Subtropical Convergence is associated with high primary productivity, and is
                          consequently where several of New Zealand’s largest fisheries are located.
                             New Zealand fisheries are managed by a property-rights based quota management
                          system (QMS), under which fishers can own catch allocation for fish stocks (Fisheries
                          Act 1996; Lock and Leslie, 2007). The Harvest Strategy Standard (2008) provides guid-
                          ance for setting fishery and stock targets and limits. A total allowable catch (TAC) is set
                          for each stock, which is split between fishers according to their annual catch entitlement
                          (ACE). ACE can be owned, leased and traded, and may only be held by companies that
                          are at least 75 percent New Zealand-owned. Catches of all QMS species must be landed
                          (with a few exceptions). Each species or species group is split into quota management
                          areas (QMAs) based on a combination of biological and administrative factors; there
                          are currently 642 stocks representing 98 species or species groups in the QMS.2 In 2016,
                          legislation required all chartered fishing vessels operating in the New Zealand EEZ to
                          be flagged to New Zealand.
                             The Treaty of Waitangi (1840) guaranteed Māori, the Indigenous Peoples of New
                          Zealand, “undisturbed possession” of fisheries until they chose to dispose of them to the
                          Crown. Breaches of the Treaty were claimed by Māori over many years and included the
                          introduction of the QMS in 1986. A Treaty of Waitangi claim was settled in 1992 that
                          guaranteed Māori 20 percent of the commercial fishing quota for new species introduced

to the QMS and enabled Māori to purchase 50 percent of a major owner of the current
fisheries quota.
    Fish and shellfish were a historically important food source in New Zealand. However,
most offshore fisheries were only developed in the 1960s, largely by foreign fleets. From
the late 1970s, fleets transitioned to joint ventures, with New Zealand companies buying
their own vessels in the 1980s and 1990s (Walrond, 2006). In 2020, the commercial
fishing industry exported NZD 1.8 billion, being New Zealand’s seventh-largest export
commodity by value and representing 3 percent of total exports (Dixon and McIndoe,
2022). It directly employed the equivalent of just over 6 300 full-time workers and was
estimated to support 16 500 full-time jobs, representing 0.7 percent of New Zealand’s
total employment (Dixon and McIndoe, 2022).
    New Zealand currently has a diverse range of small-scale and semi-industrial fish-
eries operating in coastal regions, from hand collection of abalone (Haliotis spp.) and
other shellfish, to pots for red rock lobster (Jasus edwardsii) and New Zealand blue cod
(Parapercis colias), and set nets, surface and bottom lines, and Danish, midwater and
bottom trawls, for a wide variety of finfish. New Zealand also has substantial offshore
industrial midwater and bottom trawl fisheries, with the most valuable targeting blue
grenadier (Macruronus novaezelandiae), southern blue whiting (Micromesistius austra-
lis), pink cusk-eel (Genypterus blacodes), orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus), silver
warehou (Seriolella punctata) and New Zealand lobster (Metanephrops challengeri). The
most commercially important species in the deepwater fishing sector are blue grenadier,
pink cusk-eel and Wellington flying squid. In 2022, blue grenadier represented 44 percent
of the value for deepwater fisheries and 29 percent of the total commercial fishing value
(Dixon and McIndoe, 2022). The rock lobster fishery represented 12 percent, and the
shellfish harvesting sector 8.5 percent of the total fishing value. Fishing for highly migra-
tory species represented less than 2.5 percent of total commercial fishing value (Dixon
and McIndoe, 2022).
    It is estimated that 600 000 people, or approximately 13 percent of New Zealand’s
population, go recreational fishing annually, with 1.2 million trips undertaken between
October 2022 and October 2023. Even so, compared to previous surveys, the proportion
of New Zealanders that consider themselves as marine recreational fishers has reduced,
along with the proportion of survey participants reporting at least one trip per year
(Heinemann and Gray, 2024). Over half of all recreational harvest is taken during
summer, between December and March, and about half of all recreational fishing happens
around the relatively densely populated North Island’s northeastern coastline. Silver
seabream, Australian salmon, New Zealand blue cod and bluefin gurnard (Chelidonichthys
kumu) make up over 80 percent of all fish harvested by recreational fishers (Heinemann
and Gray, 2024). In 2021, 77 species had an allowance within the New Zealand TAC for
recreational fishing, amounting to a total of 11 727 tonnes.
    Customary fisheries are recognized fishing rights of tangata whenua (people of the
land with authority in a particular place) for customary fisheries management practices
or non-commercial traditional gathering of fish. Customary activities are managed
by guardians (called tangata kaitiaki or tangata tiaki) chosen by the tangata whenua
(confirmed by the central government). These guardians are the only people who can
authorize customary fishing. In 2021, 78 species had an allowance within the TAC for
customary fishing, amounting to a total of 4 665 tonnes. The customary allowances are
decided on a case-by-case basis. A customary fisheries research fund has as an objective
to determine past levels of Māori customary and traditional harvest levels and help clar-
ify the relationship between customary and traditional rights and current harvest levels.
There are also Mātaitai reserves, which recognize and provide for traditional fishing
through local management. They allow customary and recreational fishing but usually
do not allow commercial fishing.

Southwest Pacific




                          trolling (albacore tuna) or purse seine (skipjack tuna), as well as orange roughy using
                          bottom trawl. The main tuna species targeted are albacore tuna (Thunnus alalunga), bigeye
                          tuna (Thunnus obesus), southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii), Pacific bluefin tuna
                          (Thunnus orientalis), skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) and yellowfin tuna (Thunnus
                          albacares). All assessments for tunas and other highly migratory pelagic species, except
                          southern bluefin tuna, are presented to the Scientific Committee of the Western and
                          Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC). Southern bluefin tuna assessments
                          are presented to the Scientific Committee of the Commission for the Conservation of
                          Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT).
                             The bottom trawl fishery targets orange roughy on underwater features such as
                          seamounts and hills in the Tasman Sea and east of New Zealand on the Louisville Ridge.
                          The orange roughy fishery has been dominated by industrial factory trawlers from New
                          Zealand. Management of these stocks comes under the inter-governmental South Pacific
                          Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (SPRFMO). Currently, there are no stock
                          assessments of high seas orange roughy in Area 81 (assessments used in this report only
                          include orange roughy stocks within the EEZ of New Zealand).
                             Highly migratory high seas stocks such as blue shark (Prionace glauca), striped marlin
                          (Kajikia audax) and swordfish (Xiphias gladius) also all have assumed stock units covering
                          Area 81 and the wider southwest Pacific. With regards to blue shark and striped marlin,
                          Area 81 is likely to represent a significant portion of separate stocks. The range of the blue
                          shark is global, and in the Pacific tagging studies suggest stock boundaries around the
                          equator. Further, blue sharks tagged in Area 81 have a strong tendency to remain in the
                          Area. There is likely to be a separate stock for the southern Pacific Ocean, and possibly
                          with little mixing between east and west (Sippel et al., 2011). The range of the striped
                          marlin is also global, with the highest catches coming from the Pacific. Large adults are
                          more common in the southwest Pacific, while juveniles are more common closer to the
                          equator. While stock structuring is uncertain, an increasing number of studies suggest
                          there is a separate stock in the southwest Pacific covering a large portion of Area 81
                          (Ducharme-Barth et al., 2019).
                             Although swordfish may be part of a Pacific-wide stock, it is possible that a distinct
                          sub-stock exists in the waters around Australia and New Zealand (Moore, 2020).
                          Moreover, genetic evidence strongly suggests the Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean stocks
                          are separate. However, within the Pacific Ocean stock structure is poorly understood;
                          multiple studies show mixing but at different spatial scales.

                          3. RESOURCE STATUS

                          3.1 Reference list of stocks
                          Area 81 includes countries and RFMOs with advanced fisheries management systems
                          with assessments for key species. As such, the reference list of stocks for Area 81 is largely
                          determined by what has been assessed in each jurisdiction, but with criteria and rules for
                          inclusion/exclusion based on national standards and procedures.
                             The previous FAO reference list of stocks included 29 species; this updated meth-
                          odology significantly improves the resolution and granularity of the reference list of
                          stocks by assessing 165 stocks covering 91 species (TABLE D.14.1 and APPENDIX II, TABLE 14 ,
                          pp. 473). Of the total reported catch, only a relatively small portion is reported as species
                          groups, indicating relatively good resolution in species-level data for the Area. For Eastern
                          Australia assessments, 49 stocks were included which comprised 33 fish stocks and
                          16 invertebrate stocks. For New Zealand, 114 stock assessments were included, covering
                          84 fish stocks and 30 invertebrate stocks. Finally, two high seas stocks were included.

3.2 Classification of the status of stocks
3.2.1 METHODOLOGY
3.2.1.1 Eastern Australia
Australia has a consistent national framework for assessing and reporting on the biological
sustainability of fish stocks: the Status of Australian Fish Stock (SAFS) Reports (Roelofs
et al., 2024). The SAFS stock status classification system assesses current abundance and
current levels of fishing pressure against agreed reference points. This information is
combined to assign a stock status of sustainable, depleting, depleted, recovering, negligible,
or undefined. Wherever possible the framework assigns status at the biological stock level.
Where knowledge of stock structure is insufficient to enable reporting at the biological
stock level, status is reported at either the jurisdictional or management-unit level.
   The SAFS reports were used as the basis for assigning status for Australian stocks within
Area 81, while applying the following criteria:
   1. Species are included if they are reported as a single stock within the Australian
      coastal area of Area 81 (NSW) or it is deemed likely that a substantial portion
      of the stock occurs within Area 81.
   2. Stocks assessed as negligible under SAFS, or had an annual catch < 1 tonne,
      were not included.
   3. Stocks assessed as undefined under SAFS were reviewed and, where it was
      deemed appropriate and possible, a status was assigned using a Tier 3
      (expert judgement) assessment.
   4. The stock name assigned under SAFS was used in the assessment.
   5. Any status assigned under SAFS using a recent stock assessment (past ~3 years),
      and that considered recent robust data in combination with the stock assessment
      results (weight of evidence), was assigned as a Tier 3 assessment.
   6. Since the SAFS stock status categories did not align with those used by FAO,
      status was assigned as follows:
        a. Sustainable (SAFS) = underfished (U) or maximally sustainably fished (M),
           determined by available estimates relative to reference points, or expert
           judgement.
        b. Recovering, Depleted or Depleting (SAFS) = overfished.

                          3.2.1.2 New Zealand
                          New Zealand also has a consistent national framework for assessing and reporting on the
Southwest Pacific




                          biological sustainability of fishery stocks, documented in the fisheries assessment plenary
                          reports.3 Stocks are assessed against four performance measures:
                           A hard limit – a biomass level below which a stock is deemed to be collapsed, and
                               fishery closures should be considered to rebuild the stock at the fastest possible rate.
                           A soft limit – a biomass level below which a stock is deemed to be overfished
                               or depleted and needs to be actively rebuilt using a formal, time-constrained
                               rebuilding plan.
                           A management target – the level of biomass or a fishing mortality rate that stocks
                               are expected to fluctuate around for the best balance between use and sustainability,
                               while allowing for environmental variation.
                           Overfishing threshold – a rate of extraction (percentage of a stock removed each
                               year) that should not be exceeded, as it will ultimately lead to stock biomass falling
                               below other performance measures.
                             Of these, the soft limit is considered the key performance measure for determining the
                          status of New Zealand’s fish stocks. Wherever possible, status is assigned at the biological
                          stock level; however, there is high uncertainty over stock structure for a number of species,
                          which can lead to assessments being conducted according to administrative boundaries.
                             When possible, New Zealand stocks are assessed using Tier 1 probabilistic integrated
                          assessment models. Conclusions on stock status relative to the performance measures are
                          given in terms of probabilities with categories: Virtually Certain (greater than 99 percent),
                          Very Likely (greater than 90 percent), Likely (greater than 60 percent), About As Likely
                          As Not (40 to 60 percent), Unlikely (less than 40 percent), Very Unlikely (less than
                          10 percent), and Exceptionally Unlikely (less than 1 percent). Conclusions from Tier 3
                          assessment approaches are expressed in the same way, but in these instances expert opin-
                          ion has a greater role in converting assessment outcomes into probability statements.
                             All stocks within the New Zealand EEZ fall within Area 81. The plenary reports have
                          been used for assigning status for New Zealand stocks, applying the following criteria:

                               1. The stock name assigned in the plenary document was used in the assessment.
                               2. Stocks with no status assessment were excluded.
                               3. Stocks where a Tier 3 assessment had been attempted, but from which no
                                  conclusions on status relative to the soft limit, management target, or overfishing
                                  threshold were made, were considered unassessed and therefore excluded.
                               4. FAO status was assigned as follows:
                                  a. FAO underfished (U): Any stock where the plenary has stated the stock to be
                                     considered in a near-virgin state or assessed to be at least “Very Likely” to be
                                     above the management target.
                                  b. FAO maximally sustainably fished (M): Any stock not judged underfished,
                                     and at least “Unlikely” to be below the soft limit. Many stocks in this
                                     category were assessed “About As Likely As Not” to be at the target.
                                  c. FAO overfished (O): Any stock assessed to be “About As Likely As Not” to be
                                     at or below the soft limit.
                               5. Stock status resulting from a fully quantitative (Tier 1) assessment was assigned
                                  low uncertainty unless the assessment was considered old. Stock status resulting
                                  from a Tier 3 assessment was assigned medium or high uncertainty depending
                                  on the age of the assessment.

3.2.1.3 The high seas
For Area 81 stock status reporting was included for two high seas species known to span
the western Pacific Ocean, but that are important target species throughout Area 81:
striped marlin (Kajikia audax) and swordfish (Xiphias gladius). In addition, the blue shark
(Prionace glauca) was also examined but is covered in the chapter on sharks (PART E.3,
HIGHLY MIGRATORY SHARKS , pp. 388).

3.2.2 STOCK STATUS AND CLASSIFICATION BY TIER
The majority of stocks in Area 81 are considered sustainably fished, with 75.8 percent
maximally sustainably fished and 9.7 percent underfished (TABLE D.14.2). Only 24 stocks,
representing 14.5 percent of total assessed stocks, were overfished. When weighted by
landings, the percentage of sustainable stocks increases to 95.7 percent, given that the
larger more commercially valuable stocks tend to be in better shape than some of the
smaller stocks (TABLE D.14.3).
    Most stocks in this Area were Tier 1 and Tier 3 stocks, with only 17 stocks that were
Tier 2. In Australia, 19 stocks were considered Tier 1, 16 stocks were considered Tier 2,
and 14 stocks were considered Tier 3. Of the stocks assessed for New Zealand, assessments
were fairly evenly split between Tier 1 and Tier 3 assessments (50 for Tier 1, 63 for Tier
3), and only one assessment – for green rock lobster (Sagmariasus verreauxi) – was Tier
2. The 3 high seas stocks were considered Tier 1 assessments. In Australia, Tier 3 assess-
ments were mostly done using a weight of evidence approach, noting that this used data
that generally included catch, effort and catch per unit effort data as a minimum, and that
is considered robust. Several of these Tier 3 assessments also drew on recent Tier 1 stock
assessment results, with more recent data used in the intervening period in determining
stock status (weight of evidence).
    It is worth noting that in New Zealand, all stocks of New Zealand scallop (Pecten
novaezelandiae) are currently under moratorium (customary fishing is exempted). The
Nelson and Marlborough Sounds stock is still included in the reference list of stocks
because an assessment based on surveys concluded the stock had not yet rebuilt to the
biomass target. One management area for pipi wedge clam (Paphies australis) has been
closed since 2014 and recent surveys indicate very low numbers in the areas once harvested.
The orange roughy stock on the west coast of South Island has been effectively closed since
2007 with a 1 tonne TAC.

                          4 KEY SELECTED SPECIES AND GROUPS
                          This section identifies and discusses the species and stocks that are currently most impor-
                          tant for Area 81 (FIGURE D.14.2). Although tunas constitute a part of the catch in Area
                          81, they are not included in this section since there is a dedicated chapter on tunas and
                          tuna-like species (PART E.1, GLOBAL TUNA FISHERIES, pp. 330).
                          4.1 Blue grenadier (hoki)
                          Blue grenadier (also known as hoki in New Zealand, Macruronus novaezelandiae) are
                          widely distributed throughout New Zealand waters from 34° to 54° south, in depths
                          of 10 m to over 900 m, with the greatest abundance between 200 m and 600 m. The
                          two main spawning grounds on the west coast of the South Island and in the Cook
                          Strait have been considered to comprise fish from separate stocks and have been assessed
                          separately. Before the declaration of the EEZ and the implementation of the QMS, blue
                          grenadier catches reached about 100 000 tonnes in 1977. Once it was introduced into
                          the QMS in 1986 with a catch limit of 250 000 tonnes, catches then increased to a peak
                          of 267 616 tonnes in 1998. Low recruitment saw the TAC reduced through the early
                          2000s, to 90 000 tonnes in 2007, then increase again to 160 000 tonnes by 2014 as the
                          stock rebuilt, before being reduced again in stages to the current level of 110 000 tonnes.
                             In Australia, blue grenadier is also a very important commercial species. It is taken
                          predominantly in the southern and eastern scalefish and shark fishery of southeastern
                          Australia and in 2021 the reported catch was 11 949 tonnes. The eastern Australian stock
                          is not included in status of stocks reporting for Area 81 since the vast majority of the catch
                          comes from the southeastern edges of Area 57. Overall, stocks of blue grenadier in Area
                          81 are considered to be maximally sustainably fished.
                          4.2 Small pelagics
                          Jack and horse mackerel are key species targeted in New Zealand, representing
                          90 000 tonnes of landings in 2021. In Australia, the two small mackerel species that are
                          particularly important in terms of quantity of landings are blue mackerel (Scomber austral-
                          asicus) and greenback horse mackerel (Trachurus declivis), which make up 28 percent
                          and 23 percent of the total catch reported by Australia to FAO for Area 81 in 2021
                          (51 percent overall). Other important small pelagic species are Pacific sardine (Sardinops
                          sagax) and yellowtail horse mackerel (Trachurus novaezelandiae), with 721 tonnes and
                          603 tonnes respectively reported by Australia in 2021. These species are taken principally

well managed with a conservative annual catch quota system in accordance with a harvest
strategy. Overall, small pelagics in Area 81 are primarily maximally sustainably fished.
4.3 Sillago (whiting)
Sillago are important species both commercially and recreationally in NSW. The three
main species in NSW by reported commercial catches are Flinders’ sillago (Sillago
flindersi), sand sillago (Sillago ciliata) and trumpeter sillago (Sillago maculata), with
reported catches in 2021 of 1 008, 85 and 8.7 tonnes respectively. Stout whiting (Sillago
robusta) are also caught in northern NSW, although the majority of catches from the
stock are found to the north in FAO Area 71. Recreational catch is most significant for
sand sillago and trumpeter sillago, with the most recent annual estimates being 46 and
5 tonnes, respectively. In NSW, the different sillago species are taken in different fisheries
using various gear types, depending on their preferred habitat. Overall, sillago stocks were
assessed to be underfished and maximally sustainably fished.
4.4 Orange roughy
Orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus) inhabit depths from 700 m to at least 1 500
m within the EEZs of New Zealand and Australia. They are slow-growing and may
live over 100 years, making stock productivity and sustainable catches relatively low.
In New Zealand, the EEZ is divided into eight orange roughy QMAs, and the main
orange roughy fisheries are on Chatham Rise (Stephenson et al., 2022). Where more
than one discrete orange roughy fishery occurs within a QMA, management subareas
have been implemented and separate stock assessments may be undertaken, resulting
in separate catch limits for each stock. In the Australian EEZ, there are six stocks of
orange roughy that are routinely assessed. Although there has been found to be genetic
similarity among these stocks, distinct demographic differences mean they are managed
as separate stocks. Of these stocks, the Cascade Plateau stock sits just inside the western
edge of Area 81, southeast of Tasmania. Overall, the catch of orange roughy in Area 81
was just under 10 000 tonnes in 2021, with about 9 445 tonnes attributed to New Zealand
and 436 tonnes attributed to Australia. Most of these stocks are considered maximally
sustainably fished with some stocks overfished.

                          4.5 Silver seabream (snapper)
                          Silver seabream (Chrysophrys auratus, called snapper in Australia and New Zealand) occur
Southwest Pacific




                          at depths up to 200 m, but are most abundant from 15 m to 60 m. In New Zealand, they are
                          widely distributed in warmer waters, being most abundant in the Hauraki Gulf (Fisheries
                          New Zealand, 2024). Despite challenges with overfishing in the 1980s, catch limits under the
                          QMS for commercial fisheries remain stable or have been increased in recent years (Fisheries
                          New Zealand, 2024). The snapper fishery is the largest recreational fishery in New Zealand;
                          snapper is the major target species on the northeast and northwest coasts of the North Island,
                          and it is targeted seasonally around the rest of the North Island and the top of the South
                          Island. Recreational harvests of snapper are managed using minimum legal size limits and
                          daily bag limits. Recent surveys found a three-fold increase in abundance for the southern
                          North Island stock since 2021 (MacGibbon et al., 2024), which may be related to climate
                          change-induced warming (Francis, 1993).
                             In Australia, snapper also has a widespread distribution and they are found along the entire
                          Australian coast of Area 81. A single separate stock has been shown to occur throughout
                          NSW waters extending into Queensland to the north. Snapper have been a popular target
                          species in NSW for over 150 years, both commercially and recreationally. The majority of the
                          commercial catch is taken in continental shelf and slope waters by the ocean trap and hook
                          and line fishery using a variety of fishing methods. Recreational harvest is by hook-and-line.
                          Despite recent concerns about the stock, the assessment considers silver seabream to be maxi-
                          mally sustainably fished.
                          4.6 Mullets
                          Flathead grey mullet (Mugil cephalus), referred to as sea mullet in Australia, comprise the
                          largest catch by weight of all species taken in commercial fisheries in NSW state waters. They
                          are taken in the ocean hauling fishery and the estuary general fishery. In the former, they
                          are mainly targeted using a general purpose hauling net deployed from beaches using small
                          boats, which is one of the oldest forms of commercial fishing in NSW. A single stock spans
                          the Australian east coast from central Queensland to eastern Victoria. Thus, NSW coastal
                          waters constitute a substantial proportion of the stock’s total geographic distribution. In
                          2021, Australia’s reported catch was 4 130 tonnes. The fishery is well managed using spatial
                          management units, limited entry and strict monitoring and reporting mechanisms. Overall,
                          mullets are considered maximally sustainably fished.
                          4.7 Rainbow abalone
                          Rainbow abalone (Haliotis iris), known as pāua in New Zealand, is an important commercial,
                          customary and recreational catch. They are found throughout New Zealand and may form
                          large aggregations on reefs in shallow subtidal coastal habitats, with the largest volume of
                          landings coming from the Chatham Islands. Fishers gather rainbow abalone by hand while
                          free diving; the use of underwater breathing apparatus is not permitted, except around the
                          Chatham Islands. The commercial fishery for rainbow abalone dates from the mid-1940s, and
                          there is also an important customary use of rainbow abalone by Maori for food, decorations
                          and making fishing devices. Most rainbow abalone stocks have been assessed, but qualitative
                          data suggests that significant illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) activity occurs in
                          this fishery (Fisheries New Zealand, 2024). Rainbow abalone stocks are considered maximally
                          sustainably fished.
                          4.8 Red rock lobster
                          Red rock lobster (Jasus edwardsii) is New Zealand’s most valuable invertebrate fishery. Rock
                          lobster inhabit coastal waters throughout New Zealand and are divided into nine QMAs,
                          with the most important in terms of catch volume being the south and southwest coasts of
                          the South Island. The rock lobster fisheries were brought into the QMS and TACs introduced
                          in 1990, and are also managed using minimum legal size limits, a prohibition on the taking
                          of berried females and soft-shelled lobsters, and some local area closures. There are both
                          customary fishing and recreational fishing allowances for red rock lobster, and when combined
                          these allowances represent approximately one-seventh of the TAC (Fisheries New Zealand,
                          2023). Overall, red rock lobster stocks are considered maximally sustainably fished.

4.9 Shrimps and prawns
Shrimp are highly valuable in Australia’s fisheries, and in NSW they include eastern school
shrimp (Metapenaeus macleayi), eastern king prawn (Penaeus plebejus) and jack-knife
shrimp (Haliporoides sibogae). The estuary prawn trawl fishery uses otter trawl nets to
target school shrimp and eastern king prawns in three estuaries in NSW. The ocean trawl
fishery operates offshore in NSW waters and targets all three species ranging in depth
depending on the species. Jack-knife shrimp and some eastern king prawn are also taken in
the Commonwealth trawl fishery in Area 81. The eastern king prawn is a single stock that
spans from Queensland to northeastern Tasmania with NSW representing a significant
portion of the stock’s distribution by area. Stock structure knowledge of eastern school
shrimp and jack-knife shrimp is limited.
   The reported catches by Australian authorities for 2021 were 3 030 tonnes, 1 050 tonnes
and 227 tonnes for eastern king prawn, eastern school shrimp and jack-knife shrimp,
respectively. Shrimp species in Area 81 are currently considered underfished or maximally
sustainably fished.
4.10 Blue shark
The blue shark (Prionace glauca) is caught as bycatch mainly in the tuna surface longline
fishery, with smaller bycatch by bottom longline, midwater trawl and set net. The propor-
tion of the Southwest Pacific stock catch taken in Australian and New Zealand waters
has been relatively low, with most (over 90 percent) taken at low latitudes within the stock
range. Blue shark is caught in relatively large numbers by recreational fishers, but is not a
highly regarded catch. Shark finning has been banned in Australia and New Zealand. The
blue shark in Area 81 are considered underfished.
4.11 Striped marlin
Landings of striped marlin (Kajikia audax) from within Australian and New Zealand
fisheries waters represent a relatively small proportion (about one-quarter) of commercial
landings from the greater stock in the Southwest Pacific. Most striped marlin are caught as
commercial bycatch in surface longline fishing targeting tunas. Striped marlin cannot be
retained by commercial fishers in New Zealand, and are not included in the QMS, so most
landings are made by recreational fishers. Recreational fishers use trolling or handlining in
oceanic waters over the continental shelf and slope. Striped marlin is caught by recreational
fishers and also targeted by commercial surface longline fishers in Australia. Striped marlin
in Area 81 are considered overfished.
4.12 Swordfish
Swordfish (Xiphias gladius) are sometimes targeted but are mainly caught as bycatch in the
bigeye tuna and southern bluefin tuna surface longline fisheries. The highest catch areas
for the stock within Area 81 have consistently been off the central east coast of Australia
and northeast of New Zealand. There are very few catches of swordfish taken south of
40° south. Overall, swordfish in Area 81 are considered underfished.

5 KEY FINDINGS
The updated methodology resulted in an estimated 85.5 percent of the assessed stocks in
Area 81 being considered sustainably fished. The percentage of sustainable stocks is similar
for Australia and New Zealand, reflecting strong institutional and management capacities
in both countries. Compared to the results from the previous methodology, the percentage
of sustainably fished stocks has increased from 75.9 percent to 85.5 percent (TABLE D.14.4).
This reflects the greater accuracy brought about by an increase in the number of stocks
evaluated with fewer combined stock evaluations. Indeed, the updated reference list of stocks
includes far fewer taxonomic groupings (e.g. genus or family-level) and instead reports status
either at the biological stock level, or in a way that is more closely aligned to this spatial scale
(self-replenishing populations). As a result, the updated overall estimate is considered more
comprehensive and representative as a record of marine resource exploitation than previously
reported. Overall, landings of assessed stocks in Area 81 represented 81.4 percent of total land-
ings reported in 2021, an increase from 64.8 percent covered by the previous methodology.

                             Moreover, when weighted by landings, the proportion of sustainable stocks rises to
                          95.7 percent, and the results under the previous and updated methodology are very
                          similar. This indicates that larger more commercially valuable stocks tend to be in better
Southwest Pacific




                          shape than some of the smaller stocks, and highlights that these larger stocks were likely
                          included both in the previous and updated reference lists of stocks (TABLE D.14.5).
                             An important element to note with regards to Area 81 is that there are some discrep-
                          ancies between FAO landing estimates and those used by countries for assessments and
                          management. For some species the landings reported to FAO were very similar; however,
                          there were varying degrees of difference. In some cases this appears to be due to the group-
                          ing of species for reporting. The FAO methodology on stock status is moving from a
                          catch-based approach on a species level to a continued focus on collating information on
                          the status of fished species at the stock level to provide a more accurate and meaningful
                          picture of Area 81 stock statuses.
                             To conclude, Area 81 is one of the Areas where more extensive management is applied,
                          with levels of sustainable stocks being among the highest globally (second only to Area 67).
                          This is mostly due to higher than average assessment, management and institutional
                          capacity in the two countries that primarily share this Area. Both countries have taken
                          substantial measures to curtail overfishing since the 1990s, with effective results.

  This region is a leader in managing fisheries taking into account their
   economic, social and ecological importance.
  Area 81 is one of the richest Areas in terms of data and assessments
   globally.
  There are especially high social expectations for managing fisheries, and
   eco-certification is widespread.
  Climate change has caused shifts in the distributions of many fish and
   invertebrates, and presents risks to coastal communities and their
   sociocultural connections with the marine environment.

1. OVERVIEW
The Southeast Pacific, designated byFAO as Major Fishing Area 87 (hereafter, Area 87),
spans from northern Colombia to southern Chile, encompassing ocean waters of four coun-
tries: Chile, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia. The continental shelf is predominantly narrow
with a steep slope, except for specific areas off the coast of southern Ecuador, northern Peru,
and central and southern Chile, where it can widen to a maximum of 130 km. South of
41° south, the shelf extends several hundred kilometres. Key oceanic islands within this
Area include the Galápagos Islands,
located off the coast of Ecuador, and
the Juan Fernández Islands, situated off               FIGURE D.15.1
Chile. The most suitable fishery zones                 FAO MAJOR FISHING AREA 87:
are found off the northern coasts of                   THE SOUTHEAST PACIFIC
Colombia, Ecuador, northern Peru, and
central and southern Chile, with the areas
off northern Peru and southern Chile
being especially productive (FAO, 2025).
   The northern region, encompassing
waters off the coast of Colombia and
Ecuador, is characterized by a tropi-
cal climate. This area has relatively low
productivity, with average sea surface
temperatures around 28 °C and salinity
levels of 33 parts per thousand (ppt) or
less during the rainy season and in coastal
zones. Surface equatorial currents, flow-
ing parallel to the equator, dominate
the hydrodynamic processes in this
region. Moving southward, along the
coasts of Peru and northern and central
Chile, the coastal zones are influenced
by the Humboldt-Peru eastern bound-
ary current system (HCS). The HCS is a
major eastern boundary current system
where wind causes an offshore flow in
the surface, driving intense oceanic
upwelling along the coast, bringing cold,
deep, nutrient-rich waters to the surface              Note: Refer to the disclaimer on page ii for the names and boundaries

                          cantly colder and more turbulent yet remain highly productive. Surface temperatures in
                          this region are well below 14 °C, and salinity levels average around 34 ppt. The coastal
                          zones in southern Chile are also influenced by freshwater inputs from fjords.
                             Shrimp, small coastal pelagic species, and large migratory tropical pelagic species
                          support the main fisheries in the waters off the coast of Colombia and Ecuador. In
                          contrast, small pelagic species dominate off the coasts of Peru and northern and central
                          Chile, while demersal species and benthic invertebrates sustain most of the major fisheries
                          further south. The distribution and abundance of fishery resources are strongly influenced
                          by local topography and environmental conditions, which cause substantial interannual
                          fluctuations and long-term changes in the abundance of fish and the total production of
                          key exploited species (Bertrand et al., 2018 and references therein). The HCS is subject
                          to the influence of the two phases (“El Niño” and “La Niña”) of the El Niño-Southern
                          Oscillation (ENSO) cycle (Chavez et al., 2008). These phases have drastic effects on
                          climate, fishery resources and productivity, particularly during the warm El Niño phase,
                          which occurs with varying intensity every three to seven years (Chavez et al., 2003, 2008).
                             The adverse effects of El Niño on the world’s largest single-species fishery, the ancho-
                          veta (also known as Peruvian anchovy, Engraulis ringens), are well documented (Csirke,
                          1989; Castillo et al., 2019). Its impacts on other fish populations, as well as on seabirds
                          and marine mammals, are also well understood (FAO, 2024a). Subtler, longer-term
                          environmental changes have also been cited as potential causes of variability and possi-
                          ble explanations for the observed interdecadal regional oscillations in the availability
                          and abundance of some living resources in this Area (Chavez et al., 2003; Castillo et
                          al., 2019). Evidence from the early Pliocene, when temperatures were higher than today,
                          suggests permanent El Niño conditions for this region (Fedorov et al., 2010). Extreme El
                          Niño and La Niña events are expected to become more frequent over the whole region in
                          a warming climate (Cai et al., 2014, 2015; FAO, 2024a).

                          2. FISHERY PROFILES

                          Area 87 is an exceptionally productive region that supports extensive fisheries activities.
                          It ranks as the third-highest among FAO Major Fishing Areas in terms of landings,
                          producing 10 million tonnes in 2021, equivalent to 12.5 percent of global landings (FAO,
                          2024b). In 2021, the fisheries sector involved 54 000 active vessels, of which 3 700 were
                          non-motorized, 40 700 were motorized and less than 12 m in length, and almost 10 000
                          belonged to the industrial subsector. Across the four countries within Area 87, fisheries
                          provided employment to approximately 1.5 million people in 2021, with 500 000 engaged
                          in the primary sector. The long-term average reported catch is around 9–10 million tonnes
                          per year. The high demand for commercially valuable species has led to intense fishing
                          activity, posing significant challenges to the sustainability of fish populations.
                             The long-term trend in Area 87 has been a decline in catches since the mid-1990s,
                          even when accounting for fluctuations in anchoveta (Engraulis ringens) landings. The
                          long-term analysis revealed an initial phase of expansion followed by sustained growth
                          in landings from 1950 to 1970, which was then abruptly interrupted by a sharp decline
                          in anchoveta landings. Following this decline, there was another significant increase
                          between 1974 and 1994, reaching the highest catch levels in the entire time series, with
                          over 20 million tonnes. However, after that year, catches exhibited a downward trend,
                          and are currently stabilizing at around 10 million tonnes per year (FIGURE D.15.2).
                             The anchoveta has historically accounted for over 50 percent of total landings on aver-
                          age, although with significant fluctuations due to its extreme sensitivity to oceanographic
                          conditions – particularly the occurrence of El Niño, which leads to drastic reductions in
PART D.15 ■ Regional overview ■ Area 87: Southeast Pacific                                       303




stock size. For example, the relative representation of anchoveta in total landings dropped
to as low as 1–2 percent in 1983 and 1984, as a result of the occurrence of a super El Niño
event in 1982–1983. The recent decline in total catches has been driven primarily by
reductions in two key species: anchoveta and Chilean jack mackerel (Trachurus murphyi).
However, high-value catches of jumbo flying squid (Dosidicus gigas) have grown signifi-
cantly since the early 2000s, partially offsetting the declines in other species. Catches of
jumbo flying squid increased from approximately 128 000 tonnes in 2000 to a peak of
1.15 million tonnes in 2014, before fluctuating in subsequent years and reaching 996 000
tonnes in 2021 (FAO, 2022).
2.2 Chile
Fishing in Chile is a crucial sector for both domestic consumption and export revenues.
The Chilean coast is home to a wide variety of commercially important fish species,
both pelagic and demersal. Pelagic species including anchoveta, Araucanian herring
(Strangomera bentincki) and Chilean jack mackerel make up an important part of the
country’s fisheries. The jumbo flying squid, Pacific chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus), as
well as demersal species such as mote sculpin (Normanichthys crockeri) and Patagonian
grenadier (Macruronus magellanicus) make smaller contributions to the country’s fish-
eries. Several invertebrates, which are mainly targeted by small-scale fisheries and have
considerable socioeconomic importance, include the “loco” sea snail (also known as
the false abalone, Concholepas concholepas), the Chilean sea urchin (Loxechinus albus),
the Southern king crab (Lithodes santolla), and various seaweeds (IFOP, 2024). The
productivity of Chile’s marine resources is influenced by the cold Humboldt Current,
which brings nutrient-rich waters to the region, supporting a highly productive marine
ecosystem. However, periodic events such as El Niño can impact fish availability, leading
to fluctuations in fishery yields (Bertrand et al., 2018, and references therein).
2.3 Peru
Fishing in Peru plays a vital role in the national economy, contributing significantly to
both domestic consumption and export revenues. The Peruvian coast is home to several
commercially important small pelagic species, with Peruvian anchovy making the largest
contribution to the country’s fisheries. It forms the basis of Peru’s fishmeal industry, which
is one of the largest globally. The fishing industry also includes other pelagic species such
as Chilean jack mackerel, Pacific chub mackerel, eastern Pacific bonito (Sarda chiliensis)
and common dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus), demersal species like South Pacific
hake (Merluccius gayi), and invertebrates such as the jumbo flying squid, Peruvian calico
scallop (Argopecten purpuratus), the “loco” sea snail and the cholga mussel (Aulacomya
ater). The availability of these resources is influenced by the complex interactions of the
cold Humboldt Current and the warm waters of the El Niño phenomenon, which can
lead to dramatic fluctuations in abundance, affecting overall productivity (Chavez et al.,
2003, 2008; Castillo et al., 2019).

2.4 Ecuador
Fishing in Ecuador is one of the most significant contributors to national production,
supporting both domestic consumption and export revenues. Along the Ecuadorian coast,
commercially important small pelagic fish species are distributed, such as skipjack tuna
(Katsuwonus pelamis) and Pacific chub mackerel which together represent over 40 percent
of landings. Other species targeted in Ecuador include frigate (Auxis thazard), yellowfin
(Thunnus albacares) and bigeye (Thunnus obesus) tunas, thread herring (Opisthonema spp.),
shortfin scad (Decapterus macrosoma) and Pacific anchoveta (Cetengraulis mysticetus).
Other demersal or epipelagic species are often part of the bycatch associated with small
pelagics, including trumpetfish (Fistularia corneta) and largehead hairtail (Trichiurus
lepturus). The availability of pelagic resources is mainly shaped by the influence of the
cold Humboldt Current from the south, characterized by highly fertile waters, and the
warm waters of the Panama Current (Canales and Jurado, 2024).

                          2.5 Colombia
                          Fisheries in Colombia are spread across five major basins – Amazon, Atrato, Caribbean,
                          Magdalena, and Orinoquia – and two secondary basins, Pacific and Sinú. The Pacific basin
Southeast Pacific




                          is the largest contributor, accounting for over 53 percent of production, followed by the
                          Atlantic Ocean (about 30 percent) and the inland areas (over 16 percent). Marine fisheries
                          account for 83.8 percent of Colombia’s total catch, with production steadily increasing.
                          These fisheries target small coastal pelagic species and large migratory tropical pelagics
                          (Rueda et al., 2011). Small-scale fisheries have significant socioeconomic importance, using
                          handlines and gillnets within 2.5 nautical miles of the coastline in the Exclusive Zone
                          for Artisanal Fishing (Selvaraj et al., 2023). Key resources exploited in Colombia include
                          skipjack tuna and yellowfin tuna which account for half the catch. Other important species
                          include bigeye tuna, Pacific anchoveta, Pacific sierra (Scomberomorus sierra), Pacific seabob
                          (Xiphopenaeus riveti) and western white shrimp (Penaeus occidentalis). The small-scale
                          fishery targeting Pacific sierra has contributed to local economies and food security, with
                          annual landings exceeding 1 500 tonnes in recent years (Selvaraj et al., 2022).

                          3. RESOURCE STATUS
                          3.1 Reference list of stocks
                          Historically, landings of 12 stocks from 11 species (excluding tunas) have been assessed
                          in Area 87. These include three stocks assessed by the South Pacific Regional Marine
                          Fishery Organization (SPRFMO). The historically selected species were South Pacific
                          hake (Merluccius gayi), southern hake (Merluccius australis), Patagonian grenadier
                          (Macruronus magellanicus), Pacific chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus), Patagonian
                          toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides), Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax), Araucanian herring
                          (Strangomera bentincki), anchoveta (Engraulis ringens), jumbo flying squid (Dosidicus
                          gigas), Pacific thread herring (Opisthonema libertate) and Chilean jack mackerel
                          (Trachurus murphyi). These 11 species rank within the top 22 fisheries based on historical
                          catches from 1950 to the present. The exception is the Patagonian toothfish, which ranks
                          58th, with landings barely exceeding 5 000 tonnes per year over the last 20 years.
                             In consultation with the member countries of Area 87 (Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and
                          Peru), an updated reference list of stocks was compiled, resulting in an expansion of the
                          list to 97 stocks assessed, representing 73 species, which provides a more representative
                          state of the stocks index for the Area (TABLE D.15.1 and APPENDIX II, TABLE 15, pp. 478). The
                          increasing diversity in catch composition added urgency to the need to expand the FAO
                          reference list and include fisheries targeting species of high economic value.

3.2 Classification of the status of stocks
The updated methodology classifies stocks into tiers based on the availability and quality
of information for each stock (Tier 1, Tier 2 or Tier 3; see PART B, METHODOLOGY, pp. 6).
Overall, of the 97 stocks assessed for Area 87, 46.4 percent are sustainably fished while
53.6 percent are unsustainably fished. More specifically, 18.6 percent are considered
underfished, 27.8 percent are considered maximally sustainably fished, and 53.6 percent
are considered overfished (TABLE D.15.2). With regards to the number of stocks, 18 stocks
are underfished, 27 are maximally sustainably fished, and 52 are overfished.

   The stocks for Area 87 have also been classified by tiers, according to the updated meth-
odology, with 68 stocks in Tier 1, 23 stocks in Tier 2 and six stocks in Tier 3. The stocks
classified as Tier 1 represented 70.1 percent of all assessed stocks in this Area, covering 55
species. The results from the Tier 1 stock assessments indicate that 13 stocks are under-
fished, 25 are maximally sustainably fished and 30 are overfished. Hence, 55.9 percent of
Tier 1 stocks are sustainably fished while 44.1 percent are not sustainably fished.
   The selected Tier 2 stocks were comparatively fewer in number than the Tier 1 stocks,
and in all cases the SraPlus package (Ovando et al., 2021) was used to assess them on
the basis of a surplus production model. Effort estimates were extracted from Rousseau
et al. (2019) or derived from specific inputs such as fishing effort or abundance indices
from research surveys. The estimates obtained from these applications reveal that nearly
all Tier 2 stocks are unsustainably fished, with 82.6 percent of stocks overfished. Finally,
of the Tier 3 stocks, half are fished sustainably and the other half fished unsustainably.

                             Overall, landings of assessed stocks in Area 87 amounted to about 9.17 million tonnes
                          (TABLE D.15.3), representing about 96.0 percent of total reported landings in Area 87, a
                          slight increase from the 91.7 percent coverage under the previous methodology. When
                          weighted by landings, the percentage of sustainably fished stocks in Area 87 is signifi-
                          cantly higher at 81.1 percent.

                          4. KEY SELECTED SPECIES AND GROUPS
                          This section identifies and discusses species and stocks that are currently most important
                          for Area 87 (FIGURE D.15.2).
                          4.1 Peruvian anchovy
                          The Peruvian anchovy (also known as anchoveta, Engraulis ringens) represents the world’s
                          largest single-species fishery in terms of catch volume (FAO, 2024b). The Peruvian
                          anchovy is a small pelagic fish distributed along the coast of Peru and Chile from 2° to
                          42°30´ south, depending on the coastal extent of the Humboldt Current. This species,
                          endemic to this upwelling systems, is found within the first 100 m of depth, with seasonal
                          variations: during spring and summer its distribution tends to narrow to a coastal strip
                          30–60 km wide, while in autumn and winter its range reaches up to 150 km – and some-
                          times over 180 km – from the coast. Two fishing stocks have been identified (Heck Franco,
                          2015): (1) the North-Central Peru Zone (2°–16° south), with the highest concentrations
                          and catches, and (2) the South Peru–North Chile Zone (south of 16° south), where the
                          resource is shared by both countries. In Peru, three purse seine fleets target Peruvian
                          anchovy: the industrial fleet (with storage capacities above 32.6 m³), the small-scale fleet
                          (with capacities 10–32.6 m³) and the artisanal fleet (with capacities below 10 m³, relying
                          mostly on manual, non-mechanized operations) (Heck Franco, 2015). Two additional
                          stocks of Peruvian anchovy are found in Chile, one in the north and one in the south.
                             Between 1950 and 2021, cumulative landings exceeded 370 million tonnes, accounting
                          for 7 percent of total global fish landings during that period. Consequently, the patterns of
                          fishery landings in Area 87 are primarily driven by variations in the magnitude of ancho-
                          veta landings. Peruvian anchovy landings peaked in 1970, exceeding 13 million tonnes,
                          but have experienced sharp declines, including as a result of El Niño events (Bouchon
                          et al., 2018). The recovery of the fishery has been supported by enhanced management
                          regulations. These include a total allowable catch (TAC) system, individual vessel quotas
                          and restricted access for new entrants, area- and time-specific quotas based on biomass
                          assessments, short closures (three to five days) to protect juveniles under 12 cm, seasonal
                          closures during peak spawning (winter and summer), and effort regulation by limiting
                          vessels, fishing days and processing capacity (Ñiquen et al., 2001; Bouchon et al., 2018;
                          Oliveros-Ramos et al., 2020). Fishing occurs during two annual seasons. Currently, the
                          Peru north-central stock of anchoveta supports the world’s largest single-species fishery,
                          while maintaining the spawning stock biomass (SSB) around maximum sustainable yield

(MSY) and fishing mortality (F) below FMSY. While most stocks of Peruvian anchovy
in Area 87 are considered maximally sustainably fished, some are considered overfished.
4.2 Chilean jack mackerel
During the last 70 years, Chilean jack mackerel (Trachurus murphyi) has been the second-
most important fish stock captured in Area 87. Between 1950 and 2021, cumulative
landings exceeded 87 million tonnes. This pelagic fish is distributed throughout the
southeast Pacific, ranging from the Galapagos Islands and south of Ecuador to southern
Chile. While Chile is the main country targeting this resource, it is also exploited in Peru
and Ecuador, and jointly managed through the SPRFMO (IFOP, 2024). The species is
harvested by both artisanal and industrial fleets in the countries of Area 87.
   Long-term trends show a dramatic rise and fall of landings over the second half of the
20th century and into the 21st century. From the 1950s through until the early 1970s
landings were minimal, reflecting either a low exploitation level or limited fishing effort
and technological development at the time. Beginning in the late 1970s, there was a rapid
increase in landings, which peaked in the mid-1990s at approximately 5 million tonnes.
This sharp growth aligns with the expansion of industrial fishing fleets and increased
global demand for pelagic fish. However, following this peak, landings began to decline
precipitously, likely due to overfishing and environmental changes affecting stock abun-
dance. By the mid-2010s landings had reached historically low levels, before showing
signs of recovery in recent years but remaining far below peak levels.
   The spawning biomass showed a declining trend from 1970 to 2012, with significant
fluctuations, including a historical maximum of 20 million tonnes in 1988. However,
starting in 2013, the trend reversed, rising back up to 16 million tonnes in 2023, a value
similar to that of 1991. Recent stock assessments through the SPRFMO showed that the
resource is maximally sustainably fished (IFOP, 2024; see also SPRFMO, 2024). Global
fishing mortality rates (combined fleets) exhibited a decreasing trend from 2010 to 2023,
dropping to values as low as 0.13/year, comparable to those estimated at the beginning
of the 1980s (IFOP, 2024).

                          4.3 Pacific thread herring
                          The Pacific thread herring (Opisthonema spp., included in the FAO database as
Southeast Pacific




                          Opisthonema libertate) is a small pelagic fish distributed along the Eastern Pacific, ranging
                          from Santa Rosalita (28° north) on the Pacific coast of Baja California, Mexico, southward
                          to Punta Picos (5° south) in Piura, Peru. In Ecuadorian waters, this species is found along
                          the continental coastline. However, the fishery primarily operates in productive waters
                          from the northern region of Bahía de Caráquez in Manabí Province to the southern area
                          of the Gulf of Guayaquil in Guayas Province.
                             Total landings by the industrial Ecuadorian fleet exceeded 1.2 million tonnes between
                          1950 and 2022. Currently, landings are relatively stable at approximately 20 000 tonnes
                          per year. Stock assessment models estimate the adult biomass to average around
                          86 000 tonnes, equivalent to 49 percent of the virgin biomass. Fishing mortality levels
                          are currently estimated to be 82 percent below the FMSY reference point (Canales and
                          Jurado, 2024). The resource is considered maximally sustainably fished.

                          4.4 Pacific sierra
                          Pacific sierra (Scomberomorus sierra) is a pelagic fish distributed along the eastern Pacific
                          coast, from southern California to Peru (33° north to 20° south). This species exhibits
                          high densities in the Gulf of California and along the coasts of Costa Rica, Panama,
                          Colombia and northern Ecuador, including the Galápagos Islands (Robertson et al.,
                          2023). In Colombia, it is commonly found in coastal waters, particularly in areas with
                          high salinity and high net primary production. The species exhibits a preference for shal-
                          low waters, often forming schools near the surface, which makes it accessible to artisanal
                          fishers. There is no known stock division for this species, and despite its wide distribution
                          there is no shared management framework among the countries. As a result, Colombia
                          manages the species as a single stock unit.
                             This coastal fishery in Colombia is predominantly artisanal, involving small-scale
                          fishers who utilize handlines and gillnets up to 2.5 nautical miles from the coastline in
                          the Exclusive Zone for Artisanal Fishing (Selvaraj et al., 2023). Indeed, long-term trends
                          indicate that Pacific sierra has been a significant component of artisanal landings, making
                          notable contributions to local economies and food security. Landings have increased in
                          recent years, surpassing 1 500 tonnes annually. Recent studies suggest that climate change
                          may affect the distribution of this species, potentially leading to shifts in its availability
                          to coastal communities (Selvaraj et al., 2022). This resource is subject to an annual fish-
                          ing quota based on stock assessment models that incorporate data on catch, effort, catch
                          per unit effort, and size distribution, derived from annual monitoring of artisanal and
                          industrial fisheries (Barreto et al., 2023). The stock is currently considered maximally
                          sustainably fished.
                          4.5 Invertebrates and marine algae
                          Invertebrates are playing an increasingly significant role in the fisheries statistics of the
                          region, with standout species including the Chilean sea urchin (Loxechinus albus), cholga
                          mussel (Aulacomya ater), clam (Prototaca taca), and Peruvian calico scallop (Argopecten
                          purpuratus). These resources exhibit substantial variability over time, with capture pulses
                          that may be explained by synergistic effects resulting from environmental variations and
                          the intensity of exploitation.
                             Although not included in the index of stock status, there has been a notable increase in
                          the exploitation of marine algae, including Chilean kelp (Lessonia nigrescens), Gracilaria
                          seaweeds, and Lessonia trabeculata. These species rank among the top 30 in terms of
                          capture volume, a trend that has become increasingly evident in recent years (FAO,
                          2024b). However, due to the intrinsic characteristics of their life cycle (sessile distribu-
                          tion) and the dispersal of spores or algal fragments among different areas, it is essential to
                          establish a spatially explicit approach for their analysis before making an overall assess-
                          ment of these stocks.

5. KEY FINDINGS
Overall, 46.4 percent of assessed stocks in Area 87 are being fished at or below maximum
sustainable levels, while 53.6 percent are overfished in 2021, presenting a more positive
perspective on the region’s stock sustainability status compared to the previous assessment
(TABLE D.15.4). This change might be due to some improvements in stock status, but is most
likely due to a greater representation of the stocks included in the list of reference stocks
for the Area. While this marks an improvement in terms of sustainability, the percentage
of overfished stocks remains high. It is worth noting that the majority of Tier 2 stocks are
overexploited, highlighting the need for intensifying efforts to develop robust databases
that include fishing effort and abundance indices, enabling proper monitoring of these
stocks over time.
   With the possibility of extreme El Niño and La Niña events becoming more frequent
in a warming climate (Cai et al., 2015), the dynamic nature of critical fishery resources
(e.g. anchoveta [Engraulis ringens]) and their sensitivity to environmental variability will
require adaptive management frameworks to support improved fisheries sustainability.
For instance, Peru has integrated real-time data and scenario-based planning, which can
help mitigate overexploitation risks and enhance the resilience of fisheries to environ-
mental change (Oliveros-Ramos et al., 2020). Similar frameworks should be adopted
to address fluctuations caused by climatic events, enabling more flexible and responsive
management strategies, particularly for small pelagics, which represent a significant
proportion of landings.
   The number of stocks increased significantly under the updated assessment method-
ology compared to previous FAO estimates, going from a reference list of 12 to 97 stocks
(TABLE D.15.4). In other words, the number of assessed stocks increased sixfold, providing
a more comprehensive representation of the fisheries in the region, incorporating both
long-standing and newly recognized stocks of economic and ecological importance.
When weighted by landings, the proportion of sustainable stocks under the previous and
current methodologies is similar (TABLE D.15.5). In addition, with regards to the coverage,
there has been a slight increase from 91.7 percent to 96.0 percent from the previous to
the updated methodology.
   Moreover, the updated methodology’s tiered approach allowed for a nuanced classifica-
tion of resources. Stocks categorized as Tier 1 accounted for a very high percentage of the
total number of stocks, reflecting the availability of robust, long-term landings and effort
data that enables the application of dynamic models and the estimation of reference points
for management purposes, as well as the enhanced capacity of countries in the region to
conduct formal stock assessments. A substantial amount of auxiliary information, such as
survey data, strengthened these assessment approaches. Additionally, most Tier 1 stocks
exhibited low uncertainty in their estimates due to formal stock assessments conducted
at both regional and national levels.

                             Nonetheless, the asymmetries in the quality and quantity of available information
                          among countries was evident, underscoring the need for strengthened regional coopera-
                          tion as well as stronger long-term, stable databases for a comprehensive stock assessment,
                          with efforts to improve data on other fisheries underway (Canales and Jurado, 2024).
                             The assessment for Area 87 largely focused on Tier 1 and Tier 2 stocks, with Tier 3
                          stocks only representing a minority of stocks. Stocks that could be classified as Tier 3 in
                          the region are primarily targeted by small-scale fisheries. These fisheries hold significant
                          socioeconomic importance across the region, particularly given the increasing relative
                          contribution of invertebrates and algae to regional fisheries. In fact, around 30 percent of
                          the total catch for the Americas region comes from small-scale fisheries, with this number
                          increasing substantially for some individual countries (Basurto et al., 2025). Expanding
                          the scope of future FAO assessments to include Tier 3 stocks would increase the relevance
                          and provide a more comprehensive representation of fisheries in Area 87, ensuring that
                          assessments reflect the full spectrum of fisheries. Achieving this requires tailored method-
                          ologies that address the unique characteristics of small-scale fisheries and their associated
                          data limitations.

   In addition, long-term fisheries data highlight the growing importance of differ-
ent species of algae as key resources, which should be considered in future assessments.
Adopting this continuous and adaptive approach is critical for addressing the complexities
of diverse fishery systems while fostering the sustainable use of resources and supporting
livelihoods across the Southeast Pacific.
   Finally, the results for Area 87 have significantly enhanced the understanding of stock
status in the region, and have emphasized the importance of inclusive and participatory
approaches in enhancing the accuracy, scope and representativeness of fisheries assess-
ments. The process not only improved the plausibility of assessments and confidence in
stock status estimations, but also strengthened regional collaboration by fostering inter-
action among countries. Given that several key exploited species in Area 87 cross political
boundaries, a regional approach for integrating scientific knowledge and management
capabilities to establish cohesive governance frameworks at appropriate scales is important
(Defeo and Vasconcellos, 2020). Strengthening regional cooperation through capacity
building, shared best practices, and standardized assessment methodologies will improve
data quality, comparability across countries, and the sustainability of fisheries manage-
ment. The SPRFMO could enhance cooperation among member countries, which is
important for addressing asymmetries in data quality and availability. The Permanent
Commission for the South Pacific (CPPS by its Spanish acronym), comprising the four
countries of Area 87, could also catalyse the implementation of stock assessments aligned
with ecological and jurisdictional realities, addressing data gaps and inconsistencies.

  Anchoveta is the key stock in the region and currently sustainably fished
   thanks to improved management. Some other species, such as South
   American pilchard, hakes and Patagonian toothfish, are still being
   overfished.
  This region illustrates the difference between accounting for
   sustainability in terms of landings (or weight – more than 90 percent
   of landings in this region come from sustainably managed stocks) versus
   by the proportion of stocks that are assessed as sustainable – only
   46.4 percent of the number of stocks assessed are of good status.
  Managing fisheries in this region is complex due to different fleet types
   and associated obstacles in heir management.

1. OVERVIEW
The Antarctic Area is designated by FAO as Major Fishing Areas (hereafter, Areas)
48 (Antarctic Atlantic), 58 (Antarctic Indian) and 88 (Antarctic Pacific). It surrounds
Antarctica and represents about 10 percent of the world’s ocean, extending from the coast
of the continent out to the Antarctic Convergence (FIGURE D.16.1). The Antarctic Area
is characterized by an eastward-flowing Antarctic Circumpolar Current and a series of

                       clockwise-rotating gyres that contribute to a westward-flowing East Wind Drift along
                       the Antarctic coast. The Antarctic Area has three distinct ecological zones: an ice-free
                       zone to the north, an extensive seasonal pack-ice zone between about 55°–60° south and
Antarctic Area




                       70°–75° south, and a permanent pack-ice zone adjacent to the continent.
                          The Antarctic Convergence encircles Antarctica and is formed by cold, northward-flow-
                       ing Antarctic waters sinking beneath the relatively warmer and more saline waters of the
                       sub-Antarctic. Its position varies seasonally and geographically, but is generally located
                       near 50° south in the Atlantic and Indian sectors of the Antarctic Area and near 60° south
                       in the Pacific sector. The Antarctic Convergence separates two hydrological regions with
                       distinctive marine life and climate, thereby creating an ecological boundary. Associated
                       zones of mixing and upwelling create high biological productivity, especially of Antarctic
                       krill (Euphausia superba).
                          The harvest of marine living resources in the Antarctic Area is managed by the
                       Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR),
                       which is responsible for the conservation of marine species, including seabirds, and the
                       management of fisheries (but excluding management or harvesting of whales and seals),
                       in all marine waters south of the Antarctic Convergence (in the Antarctic Area).1 As the
                       Antarctic Convergence is an oceanographic boundary and does not follow a straight-line
                       path, the CCAMLR Area is defined in Article I (4) to follow a set of defined longitude
                       and latitude points that approximate the position of the Convergence. These boundaries
                       align with those of FAO Areas 48, 58 and 88, which fully cover the CCAMLR Area.

                       2. FISHERY PROFILES
                       In the Antarctic Area, large-scale fishing for finfish began in the late 1960s, targeting
                       species such as mackerel icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari), marbled rockcod (Notothenia
                       rossii) and Patagonian rockcod (Patagonotothen guntheri). By the late 1970s, some species
                       were overfished in some areas and their fisheries were subsequently closed, while some have
                       remained closed since the late 1980s (Kock, 2000). Krill fishing started in the mid-1970s,
                       and by 1980 more than 400 000 tonnes were caught annually, representing the majority
                       of catch by weight in this region (FIGURE D.16.2). Antarctic krill (Euphusia superba) is
                       considered a keystone species in the Antarctic ecosystem with seabirds, squid, fish, seals
                       and whales relying on it as prey.
                          Concern over increased fishing and its effect on the wider ecosystem led to the estab-
                       lishment of CCAMLR. Its objective is the conservation of Antarctic marine living
                       resources, where the term “conservation” includes rational use. It promotes and follows an
                       ecosystem-based and precautionary approach to management (Article II of CCAMLR).
                       For instance, although CCAMLR does not cover the management and harvesting of
                       whales and seals, it does consider the role of these species in the ecosystem when making
                       management decisions.
                          In accordance with these approaches, CCAMLR has adopted a comprehensive set of
                       fisheries management measures to implement an ecosystem approach to fisheries manage-
                       ment. For instance, some areas are closed to certain types of fishing activity, while others
                       are open to fishing but subject to the requirements of other conservation measures. More
                       broadly, management measures in the CCAMLR Area include reducing bycatch of fish
                       such as grenadiers and skates, minimizing the incidental mortality of seabirds and marine
                       mammals, and taking into consideration the benthic impacts of bottom fishing gear.
                       CCAMLR also requires haul-by-haul catch and effort data and implementation of an
                       extensive mark-recapture programme for toothfish. CCAMLR has agreed a framework
                       to implement a representative network of marine protected areas (MPAs), and currently
                       has two: the South Orkney Islands southern shelf MPA and the Ross Sea region MPA.

                       1
                           Whaling and sealing – which currently do not take place in the CCAMLR Area – are the responsibility of the
                           International Whaling Commission (IWC) and the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals (CCAS),
                           respectively.

   CCAMLR determines catch limits and other measures necessary to manage fisheries
through analysis of extensive data collected by independent scientific observers (manda-
tory on all vessels) and catch and effort data provided by all vessels. Scientific surveys and
research provide independent estimates of stock abundance and recruitment patterns.
There are large-scale acoustic surveys of krill populations, a long-term tagging programme
implemented by toothfish vessels that generates estimates of stock sizes for toothfish, and
trawl surveys to determine the abundance of icefish and some toothfish stocks.
   Today, the main species caught in the Antarctic Area are Antarctic and Patagonian
toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni and Dissostichus eleginoides), Antarctic krill and mackerel
icefish. In 2021, 25 vessels participated in toothfish fisheries, and 15 vessels notified to
participate in the krill fishery. Catches from the CCAMLR Area are dominated by the
Antarctic krill fishery, which currently occurs almost exclusively in the Atlantic region of
the Convention Area. As a consequence, the total catch in 2021 from Area 48 of 371 526
tonnes dominated reported landings, with 15 210 tonnes of landings of toothfish distrib-
uted across all three regions, and minor landings of icefish in Area 58 (FIGURES D.16.2a,
D.16.2b and D.16.2c). A trend of increasing harvest of krill continues to attract considerable
iinternational attention due to its role as a keystone species in the Antarctic ecosystem.

3.2 Classification of the status of stocks
Because CCAMLR has stock status targets that are higher than if they were based
on single species management objectives, the status of CCAMLR stocks evaluated in
relation to CCAMLR decision rules does not translate easily to FAO classification cate-
gories, which utilize a single-species target of maximum sustainable yield. Nonetheless,
CCAMLR stock status and harvest strategies can be expressed in relation to FAO clas-
sification criteria and reference points to generate a FAO classification, allowing them to
be compared with other fisheries globally.

                          CCAMLR currently manages fisheries on Antarctic krill (Euphusia superba), mackerel
                       icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari) and two species of toothfish. Biological stock defini-
                       tions are not yet fully developed for several CCAMLR fisheries, but all current fisheries
Antarctic Area




                       are managed as individual stocks. “Current” fisheries are defined as fisheries which have
                       had harvest (including any research harvest) or a biomass assessment within the past five
                       years. Three different methods were used to align CCAMLR assessments to FAO clas-
                       sifications, as CCAMLR assessment procedures differ by species.
                          CCAMLR’s decision rules reflect all three aspects of Article II (3)2 to determine a
                       precautionary catch limit. The decision rules project stock status into the future with
                       a timeline chosen to reflect the life history of the species, and are used to determine a
                       catch limit that minimizes the probability of recruitment impairment and results in a
                       projected target stock status set in accordance with an ecosystem approach (Constable et
                       al., 2000). For krill and toothfish, there is a requirement that the probability of spawn-
                       ing stock biomass (SSB) dropping below SSB20% (20 percent of SSB 0 – which is SSB at
                       virgin levels) must be less than 10 percent over the chosen projection periods of 20 and
                       35 years, respectively. The target reference points for CCAMLR stocks are 75 percent of
                       unfished spawning stock biomass (SSB75%) for krill and SSB50% for toothfish (SSB60% for
                       toothfish in Division 58.5.1). For icefish, decision rules were developed using short-term
                       assessments to estimate catches over the next two fishing seasons that would result in
                       SSB75% . For CCAMLR fisheries of krill and toothfish, metrics for unfished and current
                       biomass typically refer to SSB0 and SSBCURR, and it is this metric that is used to classify
                       current stock status for CCAMLR fisheries into a FAO status.
                          Overall, of the 15 stocks assessed for Areas 48, 58 and 88, 100 percent are sustainably
                       fished; more specifically, 80.0 percent are considered underfished, 20.0 percent are consid-
                       ered maximally sustainably fished, and none are considered overfished (TABLE D.16.2).
                       The stocks for Areas 48, 58 and 88 have also been classified by tiers, according to the
                       updated methodology. For the stocks classified as Tier 1, the information gathered covers
                       4 species and 11 stock units. The results from the Tier 1 stock assessments demonstrate
                       that the majority of stocks are considered underfished (90.9 percent), with one maximally
                       sustainably fished (9.1 percent). With regards to the stocks in Tier 2, which represent
                       one species and four stocks, 50 percent of stocks are underfished and the other half are
                       maximally sustainably fished.
                          Overall, landings of assessed stocks in Areas 48, 58 and 88 amounted to just under
                       390 000 tonnes, with the amount of total landings and total assessed landings identical.
                       When weighted by the volume of landings, biologically sustainable stocks account for100
                       percent of the 2021 landings of assessedstocks monitored by FAO.




                       2
                           Article II (3) sets out the principles of conservation to achieve the objective of the Convention as: (a) prevention
                           of decrease in the size of any harvested population to levels below those which ensure its stable recruitment.
                           For this purpose its size should not be allowed to fall below a level close to that which ensures the greatest net
                           annual increment; (b) maintenance of the ecological relationships between harvested, dependent and related
                           populations of Antarctic marine living resources and the restoration of depleted populations to the levels defined
                           in sub-paragraph (a) above; and (c) prevention of changes or minimisation of the risk of changes in the marine
                           ecosystem which are not potentially reversible over two or three decades, taking into account the state of available
                           knowledge of the direct and indirect impact of harvesting, the effect of the introduction of alien species, the
                           effects of associated activities on the marine ecosystem and of the effects of environmental changes, with the
                           aim of making possible the sustained conservation of Antarctic marine living resources.

4. KEY SELECTED SPECIES AND GROUPS
This section identifies and discusses species and stocks that are currently most important
in Areas 48, 58 and 88 (FIGURES D.16.2a, D.16.2b and D.16.2c).3 Further details on the
status of each fishery are available in the CCAMLR fishery reports and the CCAMLR
Statistical Bulletin.4
4.1 Toothfish stocks
Six toothfish stocks have had integrated stock assessments conducted using CASAL or
Casal2 (Bull et al., 2012; Casal2 Development Team, 2024) and hence fulfill the criteria
for FAO Tier 1 stocks (Antarctic toothfish [Dissostichus mawsoni] in Subarea 88.1 and
Small-Scale Research Unit 88.2AB, and Patagonian toothfish [Dissostichus eleginoides] in
Subareas 48.3, 48.4, 58.6, and Divisions 58.5.1 and 58.5.2).5 The current stock statuses for
five of these stocks using the criterion of SSBCURR / SSB0 metric range from 37.9 percent to
65.2 percent (for FAO, BMSY in these cases is assumed to be 40 percent of SSB0). The stock
status of Patagonian toothfish in Subarea 48.3 was last agreed in 2019 at 50 percent SSB0
(SC-CAMLR-38 paragraph 3.71 and TABLE D.16.1). These stocks, therefore, are classified
using FAO categories as maximally sustainably fished (one stock) or underfished (five stocks).

   Other CCAMLR toothfish stocks can be considered as FAO Tier 2 (Antarctic tooth-
fish in Subareas 48.4, 48.6, 88.2, 88.3 and Division 58.4 [see fisheryreports.ccamlr.org],
and Patagonian toothfish in Subarea 58.7 [DFFE, 2023]). Note these status evaluations
derive from “characteristic metric 3: catch trend” of the FAO criteria (FAO, 2011). The
target metric for managing data-limited fisheries uses a proportion (gamma) of vulnera-
ble biomass, set at 4 percent of the current estimate of vulnerable biomass of toothfish in
a defined area using five-year trends in either change to catch per unit effort (CPUE) or
vulnerable biomass as determined through a mark-recapture programme. The 4 percent
value was derived from an evaluation concluding that a 4 percent harvest rate of a depleted
toothfish stock would not influence the time needed for rebuilding to the target status
(i.e. the stock size would increase at a rate indistinguishable from a non-harvested stock).
   In addition to a conservative harvest rate, fishing is only allowed in a small proportion
of each data-limited stock’s geographic range and the precautionary catch limit is updated
annually. Therefore, FAO stock status is typically classified as underfished. Several stocks
with these characteristics are not fished currently (last fished more than five years ago) and
are therefore classified as unknown; however, when fishing last occurred their FAO status
was underfished (i.e. biomass estimates were above target thresholds), with the exception
of Patagonian toothfish in Division 58.4.4.
   In relation to the Patagonian toothfish stock in Division 58.4.4, this fishery was closed
in 2002 as a result of concerns over low stock levels due to illegal, unreported and unreg-
ulated (IUU) fishing in the area. However, no evidence of IUU fishing has been reported
since 2010, and the limited research fishing conducted was managed based on a precau-
tionary harvest rate applied to the biomass in the fished area at the time, with the last year
of research fishing in 2019. A draft integrated stock assessment was presented in 2021.
4.2 Icefish stocks
There are two fisheries for mackerel icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari), one in Division
58.5.2 and one in Subarea 48.3. For each icefish stock, survey data and stock assessments are
updated annually (Division 58.5.2) or biennially (Subarea 48.3). Catch limits are set based
on the harvest rate that, when applied to the one-sided lower 95 percent confidence bound
of the current biomass estimate for the following two years, would result in 75 percent of
the vulnerable biomass remaining.

                       4.3 Krill stocks
                       Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is distributed throughout the Convention Area and
                       is a highly abundant keystone circumpolar species, especially in the seasonal pack-ice
Antarctic Area




                       zone. This is especially pronounced in Area 48, where the bulk of krill fishing takes place.
                       Antarctic krill is also dominant in Area 58, while another species – ice krill (Euphausia
                       crystallorophias) – is abundant in Area 88, but these populations are not currently fished.
                       Acoustic survey data on krill biomass have been updated periodically, most recently in
                       2019 by a large-scale multi-national survey (Krafft et al., 2021), and from 2012 to 2024
                       by annually or multi-year mesoscale surveys covering areas where the fishery operated in
                       Subareas 48.1 (Delegation of China, 2024), 48.2 (Skaret et al., 2023; Krafft et al., 2024)
                       and 48.3 (Liska et al., 2023). Acoustic surveys were conducted in Division 58.4.1 in 2019
                       (Abe et al., 2023) and in 58.4.2 in 2020 (Cox et al., 2022) for the East Antarctic region.
                          The target reference point for krill is SSB75% , which takes account of the key role of krill
                       within the Antarctic ecosystem. Application of the decision rules in the South Atlantic
                       region, where survey biomass is about 60 million tonnes, implies a precautionary catch
                       limit of 5.61 million tonnes per fishing season in Subareas 48.1, 48.2, 48.3 and 48.4
                       combined, which is less than 10 percent of the stock size (Zhao et al., 2024). However,
                       to take account of local ecosystem requirements, the catch limit applied in Subareas 48.1
                       to 48.4 is constrained to 620 000 tonnes until there is an agreed mechanism to distrib-
                       ute catches spatially and seasonally such that localized impacts on dependent predators
                       are avoided or minimized (Conservation Measure 51-01). The krill fishery in Area 48 is
                       therefore classified as underfished. However, additional measures are under consideration
                       to avoid ecosystem impacts that may result from localized depletion of krill.
                          The krill fishery was active in Area 58 until 1995, with some minor catches between 2017
                       and 2019. Revised biomass estimates were provided in 2023 based on recent surveys, but
                       the catch limits have not been updated. The FAO stock status is classified as underfished.

                       5. KEY FINDINGS
                       Overall, 15 stocks within four target species are being assessed and their status classified
                       relative to FAO stock status in the Antarctic Area (TABLE D.16.4). There are an additional 41
                       stocks of species for which fishing occurred prior to the implementation of the CCAMLR
                       Convention or prior to the development of the current management procedures and which
                       are currently not fished; no FAO stock status is provided for these stocks (TABLE D.16.5).
                          There has been an increasing trend in the annual krill harvest since 1993, demonstrating
                       progressively more interest as markets and processing technology develop. The toothfish
                       harvest has been nearly constant in recent years as the fishery on each stock is small and
                       constrained by precautionary catch limits. Icefish fisheries are recruitment-driven, and
                       the two fisheries have had little interest in harvest in recent years.
                          The Antarctic Area is noteworthy among FAO Major Fishing Areas due to the fact
                       that all assessed stocks are considered sustainably fished. Moreover, these stocks account
                       for 100 percent of the total landings in the area. This success can be attributed to robust
                       management practices, comprehensive catch reporting and effective international cooper-
                       ation, especially since the area involves transboundary fisheries. Furthermore, the strong
                       capacity for stock assessments is underscored by the predominance of Tier 1 stocks among
                       those evaluated.

 1
     Catch and effort data from fishing for Dissostichus eleginoides in Subarea 48.3 for 2022, 2023 and 2024 were received by the Secretariat.
     This fishing was carried out in the absence of a CCAMLR Conservation Measure for 48.3, since CM 41-02 was not readopted for the 2021/22,
     2022/23 and 2023/24 fishing seasons.
 2
     This stock is managed by national authorities.
 3
     Annual research fishing occurs, with catches reported through 2024.
 4
     CCAMLR assessment categories for krill will be refined in 2025 by the working groups of the Scientific Committee.

                       Catch and effort data from fishing for Dissostichus eleginoides in Subarea 48.3 for 2022, 2023 and 2024 were received by the Secretariat.
                       This fishing was carried out in the absence of a CCAMLR Conservation Measure for 48.3, since CM 41-02 was not readopted for the 2021/22,
                       2022/23 and 2023/24 fishing seasons.
                  2
                       This stock is managed by national authorities.
                  3
                       Annual research fishing occurs, with catches reported through 2024.
                  4
                       CCAMLR assessment categories for krill will be refined in 2025 by the working groups of the Scientific Committee.

                  Notes: Current research fishing and fisheries that operated before the CAMLR Convention entered into force are not included. ‘Near
                  target’ indicates stocks with biomasses (CCAMLR Assessment Categories 1 and 2) or harvest rates (CCAMLR Assessment Category 3)
                  currently or projected to be within ±5 percent of established CCAMLR targets. ‘Above target’ and ‘below target’ indicate stocks with
                  biomasses or harvest rates outside of this range. Target biomasses are 50 percent (60 percent in Division 58.5.1) of unfished spawning
                  biomass for Dissostichus spp. and 75 percent of unfished biomass for Euphausia superba and Champsocephalus gunnari. CCAMLR
                  category 1 assessments are integrated stock assessments (Dissostichus spp.) or two-year projections based on the results of recent trawl
                  surveys (Champsocephalus gunnari). CCAMLR category 2 assessments (Euphausia superba) are 20-year projections based on the results
                  of hydroacoustic surveys conducted more than five years in the past. CCAMLR category 3 assessments (Dissostichus spp.) are trend
                  analyses of catch per unit effort or mark-recapture estimates of vulnerable biomass, with target harvest rates of 4 percent for toothfish
                  in category 3. FAO status is determined on the basis of indicated FAO metric as of 1 October 2024 from FAO (2011). Blank indicates no
                  information available.

1. OVERVIEW
Among the seven major commercial species of oceanic tuna, 23 distinct
stocks are recognized for stock assessment and management
(6 albacore, 4 bigeye, 4 bluefin, 5 skipjack and 4 yellowfin tuna stocks)
by the five tuna regional fisheries management organizations (the
Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna [CCSBT],
the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission [IATTC], the International
Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas [ICCAT], the Indian
Ocean Tuna Commission [IOTC], and the Western and Central Pacific
Fisheries Commission [WCPFC]). This document reviews tuna catch
by species and gear type, summarizes the status of the stocks based
on the most recent scientific assessments, and outlines the current
management measures adopted by tuna regional fisheries management
organizations (RFMOs). The chapter is structured by RFMOs to provide
readers with a comprehensive view of the fisheries operating across
each region.
Since the onset of large-scale commercial exploitation in the 1950s, global tuna catches
have steadily risen, reaching 1 million tonnes in the mid-1960s, 2 million tonnes in the
mid-1980s, 3 million tonnes in 1990, 4 million tonnes in the late 1990s, 5 million tonnes
in 2014, and finally topping out at 5.4 million tonnes in 2019. The global tuna catch has
been stable at around 5 million tonnes since then. In 2023, the latest available data, the
global tuna catch was approximately 5.2 million tonnes.
   The majority of tuna catches are attributed to skipjack tuna (57 percent), followed by
yellowfin tuna (31 percent), bigeye tuna (7 percent), albacore tuna (4 percent), and three
species of bluefin tuna (1 percent).
   In terms of fishing methods, purse seining accounts for 66 percent of global tuna
catches, while longlines (9 percent), pole-and-line (7 percent), gillnets (4 percent) and other
miscellaneous gear (14 percent) make up the remainder (FIGURE E.1.1). Purse seine catches
are further categorized into associated sets (38 percent), unassociated sets (25 percent),
and dolphin sets (3 percent).
   In 2023 the Pacific Ocean yielded the highest catches of principal market tuna species,
contributing approximately 66 percent of the total. This was followed by the Indian
Ocean, which accounted for around 23 percent, and the Atlantic Ocean and adjacent
seas, with a contribution of about 11 percent.
   Globally, based on the most recent stock status adopted by tuna RFMOs, 16 out of
23 stocks are not overfished and overfishing is not occurring, 5 stocks are overfished but
E.1                     332                                                                                  Review of the state of world marine fishery resources



                              overfishing is not occurring (i.e. are in a state of rebuilding), and 2 stocks are overfished
                              and overfishing is occurring (TABLE E.1.1).
Global tuna fisheries




                                 Similarly, in relation to catch, 95 percent of the total catch comes from sustainable
                              stocks – that is, stocks that are not overfished and where overfishing is not occurring. This
                              is due to the fact that skipjack tuna stocks contribute more than half of the global catch of
                              tunas, and all are in healthy conditions. In contrast, two bluefin tuna stocks, two bigeye
                              tuna stocks and one albacore tuna stock are overfished; accounting for the 5 percent of
                              the total catch that comes from overfished stocks (FIGURE E.1.1).

                                 The estimated maximum sustainable yield (MSY) of all tuna populations across the 23
                              commercial tuna stocks totals approximately 6.3 million tonnes. In 2023, the total catch
                              from these 23 populations was 5.2 million tonnes. FIGURE E.1.2 illustrates the difference
                              between the catch and MSY for each stock, with each stock represented by a rectangle:
                              the colour indicates its status, while the size reflects the difference. The bigeye, yellow-
                              fin, bluefin and albacore tuna populations are fished at MSY levels, while skipjack tuna
                              could in theory generate higher yields, particularly in the WCPFC. However, in the
                              WCPFC, which is the region primarily responsible for the difference between total catch
                              and potential total MSY level (e.g. there is a 1 million tonne difference between the catch
                              and MSY of WCPFC skipjack tuna), a target reference point and management procedure

for skipjack tuna has been established, and fishing is already occurring at that MSY level,
meaning further increases would not be feasible under the current management regime.
Additionally, since almost all skipjack tuna fishing is done with fish aggregating devices
(FADs), an increase in skipjack tuna catches would likely lead to higher bigeye and yellow-
fin catches, which would be detrimental to these species.
   In conclusion, the current scenario implies a need to maintain yields, with limited
prospects for increasing yields in the future. It appears that the maximum catch under
the current tuna management framework has either been reached or is close to being
reached; therefore, further increases in catches are not likely.

   FAO uses different criteria to determine the stock status of fish populations compared
to those used by tuna RFMOs. The FAO Blue Transformation roadmap (FAO, 2022)
aims to maximize opportunities within aquatic food systems to enhance food security and
maintaining fish stocks at levels capable of producing MSY. Thus, the FAO methodology’s
targets focus on ensuring food security and maximizing catches at MSY (Hilborn, 2010).
FAO criteria include a buffer around biomass corresponding to MSY. According to these
criteria, when a stock is between 0.8 SSB/SSBMSY and 1.2 SSB/SSBMSY, it is considered
“maximally sustainably fished”, meaning that production can be sustainably maintained
but not grow. If it is greater than 1.2, the stock is classified as “underfished”, whether it

is because of a deliberate management choice for precautionary reasons or because the
fishery has not yet reached maximum sustainable production, and if it is less than 0.8, it is
considered “overfished” (PART B, METHODOLOGY, pp. 6). This difference in criteria explains
potential discrepancies in stock status determination between FAO and this chapter
(TABLE E.1.1). For the purpose of this report, the reference year for the assessments is 2021.
However, this chapter presents the most up-to-date data on tuna populations as of 2024.
In 2021, Pacific bluefin, Southern bluefin, and Mediterranean albacore tuna were all
classified as overfished according to FAO criteria. By 2024, only Mediterranean albacore
tuna remained in the overfished category. The status of the other tuna stocks remained
unchanged, except for yellowfin tuna, which shifted from being classified as fished at a
maximally sustainable level in 2021 to underfished in 2024, based on FAO criteria.

2. INTRODUCTION
Tuna and tuna-like species are important socioeconomic resources as well as a significant
source of protein for society (Pew, 2020; Guillotreau et al., 2017). Therefore, tuna fish-
eries play a crucial role in the global seafood industry, providing a vital source of food,
employment and economic value to many coastal nations (FAO, 2024). Tuna are among
the most commercially valuable fish, with millions of tonnes caught annually to meet the
demand for fresh, frozen and canned products (FAO, 2024). These fisheries support live-
lihoods in both developed and developing countries, particularly in the Pacific, Atlantic
and Indian Oceans (Bell et al., 2015). Effectively managing global tuna populations is
challenging due to their high value that generates a strong economic incentive, which
can lead to overfishing and illegal fishing practices. Additionally, climate change presents
another challenge, as it affects the productivity and distribution of these highly migratory
populations (Erauskin-Extramiana et al., 2019; Bell et al., 2021). Thus, international
cooperation is key to ensuring sustainable fishing and compliance with regulations.
   There are seven major commercial oceanic tuna species, which are extensively harvested.
These species are albacore (Thunnus alalunga, ALB), bigeye (Thunnus obesus, BET),
yellowfin (Thunnus albacares, YFT), skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis, SKJ), and the three
species of bluefin tuna, Atlantic bluefin (Thunnus thynnus, BFT), Pacific bluefin (Thunnus
orientalis, PBF) and southern bluefin (Thunnus maccoyii, SBT). These species can perform
long migrations and their spatial distribution includes temperate and tropical regions
of all oceans (Collette et al., 2001). Based on their distribution and habitat preferences,
tunas are categorized into “temperate” and “tropical” species (Block and Stevens, 2001).
The temperate tunas, including bluefins and albacore, can inhabit waters as cold as 10 °C
but are also found in warmer tropical regions. Conversely, tropical tunas such as skipjack
tuna and yellowfin tuna thrive in waters above 18 °C, while bigeye tuna exhibit interme-
diate habitat preferences (Korsmeyer and Dewar, 2001). The biological characteristics,
migratory patterns and growth rates of these species directly impact fishery management
strategies and stock assessments (BOX E.1.1).
   Various industrial fleets, along with artisanal fleets from coastal states, catch these
species in the three oceans (ISSF, 2024). They are then landed and processed in multiple
locations worldwide, traded on a global market, and ultimately consumed around the
world. Over the past decades, tuna catches have exhibited a consistent upward trend,
stabilizing in the early 2000s before resuming growth in recent years (FIGURE E.1.3).
The global annual catches of commercial tunas have continuously increased over time
since the beginning of their exploitation in the 1950s, reaching 1 million tonnes in
the mid-1960s, 2 million tonnes in the mid-1980s, 3 million tonnes in 1990, 4 million
tonnes in the late 1990s, 5 million tonnes in 2014, and finally topping out at approx-
imately 5.4 million tonnes in 2019 (FIGURE E.1.3). The global tuna catch has remained
stable at around 5 million tonnes since then. In 2023, the global tuna catch was approx-
imately 5.2 million tonnes. The majority of tuna catches are attributed to skipjack tuna
(57 percent), followed by yellowfin tuna (31 percent ), bigeye tuna (7 percent), albacore
tuna (4 percent) and bluefin tuna (1 percent).

                                                       In 2023 the Pacific Ocean yielded the highest catches of principal market tuna species,
                                                    contributing approximately 66 percent of the total. This was followed by the Indian Ocean,

                                                    which accounted for around 23 percent, and the Atlantic Ocean and adjacent seas, which
                                                    contributed the remaining 11 percent.
                                                       In terms of fishing methods, purse seining accounts for 66 percent of global tuna
                                                    catches, while longlines (9 percent), pole-and-line (7 percent), gillnets (4 percent) and other
                                                    miscellaneous gear (14 percent) make up the remainder (FIGURE E.1.3). Purse seine catches
                                                    are further categorized into associated sets (38 percent), unassociated sets (25 percent),
                                                    and dolphin sets (3 percent).
                                                       The relative contribution of each gear to total tuna catches has changed over time. In
                                                    the 1950s, most catches were taken with trolling and pole-and-line gear, accounting for
                                                    20 percent and 40 percent of the total catch, respectively. However, their share declined
                                                    rapidly with the expansion of longline fleets, which accounted for around 50 percent
                                                    of catches by 1960. By that time, the contribution of trolling and pole-and-line gear
                                                    had decreased to 7 percent and 25 percent, respectively. Purse-seine gear accounted for
                                                    15 percent of total catches at this time.
                                                       From 1960 onward, longline contributions gradually declined to around 30 percent by
                                                    1970 and remained at that level until the mid-1980s. Meanwhile, pole-and-line maintained
                                                    a 30 percent share until the early 1980s, while purse-seine contributions continued to rise,
                                                    reaching 40 percent of total catches by the 1980s. The continuous increase in total catches
                                                    since then has primarily been driven by the expansion of purse-seine fisheries. In recent years,
                                                    purse-seine gear has contributed approximately 65 percent of total catches (FIGURE E.1.3).
                                                       Longline catches increased steadily from 1950, peaking at about 0.7 million tonnes
                                                    in 1993. Since then, they have fluctuated between 0.6 million tonnes and 0.7 million
                                                    tonnes until 2007, and between 0.42 million tonnes and 0.55 million tonnes thereafter.
                                                    Similarly, pole-and-line catches increased from 1950, reaching a record high of approxi-
                                                    mately 0.6 million tonnes in 1984, before declining to 0.4 million tonnes by 2014, where
                                                    they have since remained. In contrast, purse-seine catches have steadily increased from
                                                    1950 to 2023, reaching an all-time high of around 3.6 million tonnes in 2019 (FIGURE E.1.3).

trend described above. However, for temperate tunas, the contribution of different gears
has remained relatively stable since 1960. The primary gears targeting temperate tunas are
longline and pole-and-line, though the contribution of purse seine has slightly increased
in recent years, particularly for bluefin tunas.
   The increasing trend in total tuna catch is primarily due to the expansion of tropical tuna
fisheries (FIGURE E.1.4). In fact, the tropical tuna catch has risen continuously since 1950,
reaching the highest recorded level in the time series in 2019, at approximately 5 million
tonnes. A similar increasing trend is observed for each tropical tuna species. For example,
the yellowfin tuna catch peaked at around 1.5 million tonnes in 2003, then declined to
1.2 million tonnes in 2009 before rising again to a new record high of 1.6 million tonnes
in 2023. Meanwhile, the skipjack tuna catch reached its highest level in 2019, with a total
of about 3.2 million tonnes, and has remained at around 3 million tonnes since then
(FIGURE E.1.4). However, bigeye tuna followed a different trend, with catches peaking at
approximately 510 000 tonnes in 1997, then declining to around 400 000 tonnes until 2013
and stabilizing between 370 000 tonnes and 400 000 tonnes thereafter.

   The catch history of temperate tunas differs from that of tropical tunas. Their catches
also increased from 1950, reaching a peak of around 380 000 tonnes in 1999 (FIGURE E.1.4).
Since then, however, they have followed a declining trend, reaching the third-lowest

                              observed in albacore and the three bluefin tuna species. For instance, the albacore tuna

                              catch steadily increased until reaching a record high of 280 000 tonnes in 2002, then
                              declined and has remained between 200 000 tonnes and 250 000 tonnes since. The three
                              bluefin tuna species show a different historical pattern. Their catches increased until a
                              record high of approximately 140 000 tonnes early in the time series in 1961, followed by a
                              general decline until 1993. At that point, an upward trend began, reaching 100 000 tonnes
                              in 2000. Since then, catches have decreased again, hitting a record low of 38 000 tonnes in
                              2013 – the lowest level since 1951. However, since 2013 catches have been increasing due
                              to population recovery, and in 2023 the total catch of the three species reached approxi-

                                 For management purposes, 23 stocks of oceanic tuna species are recognized. The
                              Atlantic Ocean has three albacore tuna stocks: North Atlantic, South Atlantic, and
                              Mediterranean. In the Pacific there are two albacore tuna stocks, one in the North Pacific
                              and another in the South Pacific, while the Indian Ocean has a single stock. Atlantic blue-
                              fin tuna is divided into two stocks: a western stock and an eastern stock, which includes
                              the Mediterranean Sea. Pacific bluefin tuna consists of a single stock, as does southern
                              bluefin tuna, which inhabits the southern regions of all three oceans. For bigeye and
                              yellowfin tunas, the Pacific Ocean is divided into two stocks – eastern and western –
                              whereas both the Atlantic and Indian Oceans each have a single stock. Similarly, skip-
                              jack tuna is managed as two stocks in both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans (eastern and
                              western, respectively), while the Indian Ocean has a single stock (see BOX E.1.1).
                                 Given the economic and ecological significance of tuna, international organizations,
                              such as the five tuna regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs), manage
                              tuna stocks to prevent overexploitation and achieve sustainable fishing practices (Allen,
                              2010; De Bruyn et al., 2013). Scientific committees within each tuna RFMO conduct
                              annual stock assessments based on data related to abundance, fishing effort and envi-
                              ronmental factors, and provide scientific advice for management decisions. Ultimately,
                              the Commissions of these organizations adopt binding management measures that each
                              member implements. The five tuna RFMOs are (FIGURE E.1.5):

3. DATA AND METHODOLOGY

3.1 Stock status determination criteria
The assessment of tuna stock status relies on two primary indicators, the spawning stock
biomass (SSB), usually defined as the total abundance of the female population, and the
fishing mortality or exploitation rate (F). Stock status is estimated using biological and
fishing mortality maximum sustainable yield (MSY) reference points commonly used
in most of the tuna RFMOs: SSB/SSBMSY defined as the spawning stock biomass (SSB)
relative to the spawning stock biomass at MSY and F/FMSY defined as the fishing mortality
(F) relative to the F at which MSY can be obtained. As such, when the abundance of each
stock falls below SSBMSY, the stock is considered overfished in most tuna RFMOs and in
this analysis. When the fishing mortality (F) exceeds FMSY, tuna RFMOs consider that
overfishing is occurring with the stock being at risk of becoming overfished.
   Stock status is commonly represented by a Kobe plot, as produced by the scientific
bodies of each tuna RFMO (FIGURE E.1.6). The Kobe plot represents SSB/SSBMSY and
F/FMSY as references in a figure with four different zones, each representing a different
stock status: (1) red zone, representing an overfished stock and that overfishing is occur-
ring; (2) green zone, representing a situation where no overfishing is taking place and
where the stock is not overfished; (3) orange zone, where overfishing is occurring while
the stock is not overfished; and (4) yellow zone, where overfishing is not taking place but
the stock is overfished.

                                 Moreover, for comparison, the FAO stock status classification – based solely on popu-
                              lation abundance or biomass – is also included in each species-specific stock status
                              determination. Since the FAO Blue Transformation roadmap (FAO, 2022) aims to maxi-
                              mize opportunities in aquatic food systems to enhance food security, FAO determines
                              the stock status of fish populations in relation to maximizing catches at MSY. FAO crite-
                              ria include a buffer around biomass corresponding to MSY. According to these criteria,
                              when a stock is between 0.8 and 1.2 SSB/SSBMSY, it is considered “maximally sustainably
                              fished”. If it is greater than 1.2, the stock is classified as “underfished”, and if it is less than
                              0.8, it is considered “overfished” (see PART B, METHODOLOGY, pp. 6).

3.2 Tuna catch data and management
The annual tuna catch information in this document is sourced from the publicly available
nominal catch data or the best available scientific estimates datasets from the respective
tuna RFMOs, which are updated annually following each RFMO’s scientific committee
meeting:

    bulletins (last access in October 2024); ISC. ISC24 Annual Catch Table. Fisheries
    statistics. 2024. https://isc.fra.go.jp/fisheries_statistics/index.html (last access in
    September 2024).
   Catch data is presented by the following main gear type categories: purse seine, longline,
pole and line, gillnet, and other. The nominal catch data for tunas used in this document
covers up to the year 2023, as this is the most recent data currently available in publicly
accessible tuna RFMO catch datasets.
   In terms of management, tuna RFMOs are increasingly embracing management
procedures (MP) (also known as harvest strategies), tested using management strat-
egy evaluation (MSE), as a modern and precautionary management tool to ensure the
sustainability of their tuna stocks (Punt et al., 2016). The first tuna RFMO to adopt a
management procedure was the CCSBT when it adopted one for the recovery of south-
ern bluefin tuna in 2011 (Hillary et al., 2016). Since then, the other tuna RFMOs have
adopted management procedures, or in some instances harvest control rules , for several
of their tuna stocks. The use of management procedures differs between RFMOs. For
instance, while some RFMOs have adopted some elements of the management procedures
(e.g. the harvest control rule), others have adopted them in full, including the monitoring
strategy and the revision of exceptional circumstances (BOX E.1.2).
   Thus, this chapter provides an overview of tuna stock status, global catches, and
management strategies based on the most recent scientific assessments. It summarizes
RFMO findings, highlighting stock-specific trends and conservation measures. The
chapter is structured by ocean region to align with RFMO mandates, and catches are
shown by different gear types. For the purpose of this report, the reference year for the
assessments is 2021. However, this chapter presents the most up-to-date data on tuna
populations as of 2024. In 2021, Pacific bluefin, Southern bluefin, and Mediterranean
albacore tuna were all classified as overfished according to FAO criteria. By 2024, only
Mediterranean albacore tuna remained in the overfished category. The status of the other
tuna stocks remained unchanged, except for Atlantic yellowfin tuna , which shifted from
being classified as fished at a maximally sustainable level in 2021 to underfished in 2024,
based on FAO criteria.

Global tuna fisheries




                                                    4.1 EASTERN
                                                    PACIFIC OCEAN

                                                    Approximately 13 percent of the
                                                    world’s tuna production comes
                                                    from the Eastern Pacific Ocean
                                                    (EPO) – FAO Major Fishing Areas
                                                    67, 77 and 87. In 2023, catches of
                                                    skipjack tuna, yellowfin tuna and bigeye tuna totaled around 761 800
                                                    tonnes, reflecting a 15 percent increase from 2022. The catch of tropical
                                                    tunas in the EPO steadily increased since 1990s, reaching a record high
                                                    of 800 000 tonnes in 2003. Total catches then declined until 2007 but
                                                    have again been rising since, reaching the second-highest level in the
                                                    entire time series in 2023 (FIGURE E.1.7). Catches of Pacific albacore tuna
                                                    and Pacific bluefin tuna also occur in the EPO; however, these stocks
                                                    are covered in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean section, as they
                                                    are distributed there too.
                                                    Average annual tropical tuna catches for the last five-year period (2019–2023) totalled
                                                    683 100 tonnes. During this recent period, skipjack tuna accounted for 49 percent of the
                                                    catches by weight, followed by yellowfin tuna (39 percent) and bigeye tuna (12 percent).
                                                    Purse-seine vessels took 95 percent of the total catch, followed by longliners (5 percent).
                                                    During this time the skipjack tuna catch continuously increased to peak at around 390 000
                                                    tonnes in 2023, the highest level on record. Meanwhile, the yellowfin tuna catch reached
                                                    its highest level in 2002, with a total of about 410 000 tonnes, and decreased to around
                                                    230 000 tonnes in 2020, before increasing to 300 000 tonnes in 2023 (FIGURE E.1.7).
                                                    However, bigeye tuna followed a different trend, with catches peaking at approximately
                                                    140 000 tonnes in 2000 and declining since then to 70 000 tonnes in 2023, the lowest
                                                    catch since 1984.

4.1.1 Catches by species

BIGEYE TUNA
Bigeye tuna catches in 2023 were about 67 000 tonnes, a 2 percent decrease from 2022.
Longline fishing dominated the catches in weight until the mid-1990s. However, in
recent years purse-seine fishing accounts for a majority of the catch (71 percent), while
longlining accounts for 29 percent (FIGURE E.1.8). Bigeye catches in the EPO by other
gears are negligible.
YELLOWFIN TUNA
The yellowfin tuna fishery started at the beginning of the 1920s. Until about 1960, fishing
was dominated by pole-and-line vessels; however, in the early 1960s pole-and-line vessels
were converted into purse seiners, which have been the main gear since then (96 percent
of the catch). The recent catches by purse seiners were about 70 percent (300 000 tonnes)
of the record high caught in 2002 of 412 000 tonnes (FIGURE E.1.8). Catches from longline
vessels, although smaller in magnitude, have also declined substantially in recent years.
SKIPJACK TUNA
In 2023, skipjack tuna catches were about 388 800 tonnes, a 31 percent increase from
2022. Skipjack tuna catches in the EPO are notoriously variable (FIGURE E.1.8). Purse-seine
fishing dominates the catches, accounting for nearly 100 percent of the total.

Global tuna fisheries




                              BIGEYE TUNA
                              In 2024, to evaluate stock status, the IATTC conducted a benchmark assessment that
                              continues to use a risk analysis approach (Xu et al., 2024). The risk analysis encompasses
                              three hypotheses structured hierarchically to address the main uncertainties, resulting in
                              a total of 33 different models. The results of the assessment and risk analysis indicate that
                              bigeye is not overfished and is likely fluctuating around the target level of SSBMSY, and
                              that it is likely being exploited below the target level of FMSY, indicating that overfishing
                              is not occurring (TABLE E.1.2 and FIGURE E.1.9).
                              YELLOWFIN TUNA
                              In 2024, the IATTC attempted to conduct a stock assessment (Minte-Vera et al., 2024),
                              but the staff deemed that the model results were not sufficiently reliable to provide
                              management advice. The results of the previous assessment (Minte-Vera et al., 2020) and
                              risk analysis in 2020 (Aires-da-Silva et al., 2020) indicated the stock was not overfished
                              and overfishing was not occurring. However, the model-weighted average of MSY
                              across all models was estimated to be 288 000 tonnes, and current catches (306 000
                              tonnes in 2023) are above the estimated MSY.
                              SKIPJACK TUNA
                              In 2024, IATTC staff conducted a benchmark stock assessment (Bi et al., 2024) using
                              an integrated age-structured catch-at-length model and concluded that the stock is most
                              likely not overfished and overfishing is not occurring (TABLE E.1.2).

   In 2024, the IATTC updated the stock status indicators that serve as supplemental
information to monitor the stocks of bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack tuna. Most fish aggre-
gating device (FAD) fishery indicators suggest that the stocks for all three tropical tuna
species have potentially been subject to increased fishing mortality, mainly due to the
increase in the number of sets in the FAD fishery. The number of sets on floating objects
in 2022 reached the highest value since 2000. The catch of yellowfin tuna and skipjack
tuna on floating object sets were the highest in the time-series. However, for bigeye, both
catch in weight and catch-per-set on floating-object sets are at the lowest level since 2000,
which may partly be a result of the introduction of the bigeye catch threshold scheme
per vessel in 2021 (Resolution C-24-01). An evaluation of the impact of this scheme
confirmed that it likely had a positive effect on reducing bigeye tuna catches in 2022 and
2023 (Ovando et al., 2024).
4.1.3 Management procedures
There is an ongoing        strategy evaluation (MSE) process for tropical tunas at the
IATTC, adopted through Resolution C-19-07. This process has included introductory
workshops for the fishing industry, managers and other stakeholders, as well as technical
developments to refine the MSE framework and improve simulation models.
   In 2016, the IATTC adopted a harvest control rule (HCR) for the tropical tuna
purse-seine fishery, based on interim target and limit reference points established in 2014
(Resolution C-16-02, later amended by C-23-06). The HCR aims to prevent fishing
mortality from exceeding the MSY level for the tropical tuna stock (bigeye, yellowfin or
skipjack tuna) that requires the strictest management. Additionally, if fishing mortality or
spawning biomass approaches or exceeds the corresponding limit reference point – with
an estimated probability of 10 percent or greater – the HCR triggers the implementa-
tion of additional management measures to reduce fishing mortality and support stock
rebuilding.

                              jack tuna is Resolution C-24-01, which establishes a multi-annual management measure
                              for tropical tunas in the Eastern Pacific Ocean during 2025–2026. This measure calls for:
                               An annual 72-day closure for purse seiners greater than 182 tonnes capacity
                                 through January 2027.
                               Additional 13 to 22 days of closure for vessels exceeding a particular annual bigeye
                                 tuna catch limit in a previous year.
                               A seasonal closure of the purse seine fishery in an area known as “El Corralito”.
                               A full retention requirement for all purse seine vessels regarding bigeye, skipjack
                                 and yellowfin tunas.
                               Bigeye tuna catch limits for the main longline fishing nations.
                               Limits on the number of active FADs from 50 FADs/vessel for the smallest to
                                 340 FADs/vessel for Class 6 vessels (1 200 m3 capacity) in the 2025–2026 period.
                               No deployment of FADs 15 days before the selected closure period.
                               Provision of daily information on all active FADs (position and echosounder
                                 biomass data) as well as Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) data to the Secretariat.

4.2 WESTERN AND
CENTRAL PACIFIC OCEAN

About 51 percent of the
world’s production of tuna is
from the Western and Central
Pacific Ocean (WCPO) – FAO
Major Fishing Areas 61, 71 and
81. Provisional catches of skipjack tuna, yellowfin tuna and bigeye
tuna in 2023 were 2 490 300 tonnes, a 2 percent decrease from 2022;
and provisional catches of North Pacific albacore tuna, South Pacific
albacore tuna and Pacific bluefin tuna were 120 000 tonnes, a 25 percent
decrease from 2022. Note that despite catches of North Pacific albacore
tuna, South Pacific albacore tuna and Pacific bluefin tuna occurring
throughout the entire Pacific Ocean (i.e. in both the IATTC and WCPFC
areas), they are reported under this section dealing with the WCPFC.
The catch of tropical tunas in the WCPO steadily and continuously increased by around
half a million tonnes per decade since the 1960s, reaching 1 million tonnes in 1984,
1.5 million tonnes in 1994, and 2 million tonnes in 2005, before peaking at a record
high of 2.7 million tonnes in 2014. Since then, total catches have stabilized at around
2.5 million tonnes (FIGURE E.1.10). Catches of North Pacific albacore, South Pacific
albacore and Pacific bluefin tuna also steadily increased to 175 000 tonnes from 1950 to
1973, then decreased to 89 000 tonnes by 1991 (the third-lowest level in the time series).
They then increased again, reaching a peak of 204 000 tonnes in 2002, before showing a
decreasing trend, reaching around 120 000 tonnes in 2023 (FIGURE E.1.10).
   Average tuna catches for the last five-year period (2019–2023) were 2 747 415 tonnes.
During this period, skipjack tuna accounted for 64 percent of the total catch by weight,
followed by yellowfin tuna (26 percent), bigeye tuna (5 percent), North Pacific alba-
core tuna (2 percent), South Pacific albacore tuna (2.5 percent) and Pacific bluefin tuna
(0.5 percent). Purse-seine vessels took 70 percent of the total catch, followed by longline
(9 percent), pole-and-line (6.5 percent), and other gears (14.5 percent).
   The skipjack tuna catch continuously increased, peaking at around 2 million tonnes in
2019 – the highest on record – before stabilizing at around 1.6–1.7 million tonnes since
then. Meanwhile, the yellowfin tuna catch reached its highest level in 2021, totaling about
750 000 tonnes, and has remained at that level since (FIGURE E.1.11).
   However, bigeye tuna, South Pacific albacore tuna, North Pacific albacore tuna and
Pacific bluefin tuna followed different trends, with catches peaking at different times:
in the 2000s for bigeye tuna and North Pacific albacore tuna, in 2010 for South Pacific
albacore tuna, and in 1956 for Pacific bluefin tuna. In all cases, catches have declined
since their peak records in the time series.

                                                  4.2.1 Catches by species

                                                  BIGEYE TUNA
                                                  Provisional bigeye tuna catches in 2023 were about 133 700 tonnes, a 7 percent decrease
                                                  from 2022. Longline fishing dominated the catches by weight until the mid-1990s.
                                                  However, the relative contribution of purse seine to the catch in recent years has increased.
                                                  For example, in the most recent five years, the main fishing gears are purse seine and
                                                  longline with 44 percent and 39 percent of the catch, respectively (FIGURE E.1.11). Bigeye
                                                  catches in the WCPO by other gears were relatively minor, but have increased in recent
                                                  years.
                                                  YELLOWFIN TUNA
                                                  Provisional yellowfin tuna catches in the WCPO in 2023 were about 737 400 tonnes,
                                                  an 8 percent increase from 2022. Until about 1980, fishing was dominated by longline
                                                  and pole-and-line vessels; however, since the early 1980s purse seine has been the main
                                                  gear. In the last five years purse seiners caught around 55 percent of the total catch, while
                                                  31 percent of the catch was taken by a number of mixed gears in the Philippines and
                                                  Indonesia, and 11 percent was taken by longliners (FIGURE E.1.11). Most of the catches are
                                                  taken from the tropical region where the stock is considered fully exploited and there is
                                                  little or no room for increased fishing pressure.
                                                  SKIPJACK TUNA
                                                  The WCPO skipjack tuna stock supports the largest tuna fishery in the world, accounting
                                                  for 35 percent of worldwide tuna landings. Catches in 2023 were 1 619 100 tonnes, a
                                                  6 percent decrease from 2022. Purse seining, which accounts for 83 percent of the catches,
                                                  has increased steadily over the past three decades. In contrast, pole-and-line fishing (about
                                                  8 percent) has been declining since the mid-1980s (FIGURE E.1.11).
                                                  NORTH PACIFIC ALBACORE TUNA
                                                  North Pacific albacore tuna provisional catches in 2023 were about 34 000 tonnes, a
                                                  31 percent decrease from 2022. Approximately 77 percent of the catch occurs in the
                                                  WCPO and 23 percent in the EPO. The main fishing gears are longline (45 percent) and
                                                  pole-and-line (31 percent), followed by trolling (19 percent) (FIGURE E.1.11). Catches by
                                                  longline have shown a decreasing trend since 1999.

SOUTH PACIFIC ALBACORE TUNA
South Pacific albacore tuna extends beyond the WCPFC Convention Area. However, the
stock is assessed by WCPFC. South Pacific albacore tuna provisional catches in 2023 were
about 67 700 tonnes, a 26 percent decrease from 2022 catches. Approximately 70 percent
of the catch occurs in the WCPO and 30 percent in the EPO. The main fishing gear is
longline, accounting for 95 percent of the catch. Relatively minor amounts are taken by
other gears like trolling (FIGURE E.1.11).
PACIFIC BLUEFIN TUNA
Reported Pacific bluefin tuna provisional catches in 2023 were about 18 200 tonnes,
a 3 percent increase from estimates available for 2022. Most of the catch (71 percent)
occurs in the Western Pacific Ocean. About 52 percent of the Pacific-wide catch is made
by purse-seine fisheries, followed by a variety of gears such as coastal set nets and troll
(29 percent) and longline (18 percent) (FIGURE E.1.11).

Global tuna fisheries




                              BIGEYE TUNA
                              In 2023, the Pacific Community (SPC) conducted an assessment (Day et al., 2023) that
                              included some improvements and a more rigorous approach than the previous assessment
                              in 2020. All models in the uncertainty grid indicated that the stock is above the biomass
                              limit reference point as well as MSY-based reference points. Therefore, the stock is not
                              overfished and overfishing is not occurring (TABLE E.1.3 and FIGURE E.1.12).
                              YELLOWFIN TUNA
                              The last yellowfin tuna assessment was conducted in 2023 (Magnusson et al., 2023). The
                              results were in general less optimistic compared to previous assessments. All models in the
                              uncertainty grid indicate the stock is above the biomass limit reference point as well as
                              MSY-based reference points. Therefore, the assessment results indicate that the stock is
                              not overfished and overfishing is not occurring. However, the current (2023) catches
                              are larger than the median MSY, estimated to be 700 400 tonnes.
                              SKIPJACK TUNA
                              The last skipjack tuna assessment was conducted in 2022 (Castillo Jordan et al., 2022).
                              Stock status was determined over an uncertainty grid of 18 models. There were several
                              new developments and improvements to the stock assessment compared to the 2019
                              assessment, including the application of a new approach to estimate fishing mortality,
                              the inclusion of an alternative growth model, and the use of new free-school indices of
                              abundance. The results of the assessment indicate that the stock is not overfished and
                              overfishing is not occurring.
                              NORTH PACIFIC ALBACORE TUNA
                              The last North Pacific albacore tuna stock assessment was conducted in 2023 (ISC, 2023)
                              and the results indicated that the stock is not overfished and overfishing is not occurring.
                              However, the stock assessment showed that increasing fishing effort is unlikely to result in
                              higher yield.
                              SOUTH PACIFIC ALBACORE TUNA
                              The last full assessment was conducted in 2024 (Teears et al., 2024) and indicated the
                              stock is not overfished and that overfishing is not occurring.
                              PACIFIC OCEAN BLUEFIN TUNA
                              In 2024, a benchmark stock assessment was conducted (ISC, 2024). All aspects of the
                              model were critically reviewed, and some modifications were made to improve the model.
                              The assessment estimated that the SSB was 23.2 percent of the unfished level, having
                              achieved the second rebuilding target set by the WCPFC and the IATTC in 2021. The
                              point estimate of the depletion level is now above the biomass depletion-based limit refer-
                              ence point of 20 percent of the unfished stock biomass set by the WCPFC. Although the
                              assessment indicated that the stock is overfished, overfishing is likely not occurring.
                              Pacific bluefin tuna was heavily overfished but has now rebuilt to interim rebuilding
                              targets. Management has been implemented to rebuild the stock towards higher target
                              reference points that are currently being estimated.

Global tuna fisheries




                              There is ongoing work under a mixed fishery framework that involves developing stock-spe-
                              cific management procedures for skipjack, yellowfin, bigeye and South Pacific albacore
                              tunas, in line with the agreed WCPFC harvest strategy workplan. The interaction of these
                              management procedures, as well as their impact on yellowfin tuna, would then be evaluated
                              using a combined mixed fisheries evaluation framework.
                              SKIPJACK TUNA
                              The skipjack tuna in the WCPO is managed through a management procedure CMM
                              2022-01. The management procedure applies to the catch and effort of purse-seine and pole-
                              and-line fisheries, and other commercial fisheries referred to in CMM 2022-01 taking more

                              economic zones and areas beyond national jurisdiction. The objectives of the management
                              procedure ensure that the spawning potential depletion ratio of skipjack tuna is maintained
                              on average at a level consistent with the target reference point; and the spawning potential
                              depletion ratio of skipjack tuna is maintained above the limit reference point with a risk
                              of the limit reference point being breached of no greater than 20 percent; in a manner that
                              achieves the objective of relative stability in fishing levels between management periods and
                              in the longer term.
                              NORTH PACIFIC ALBACORE TUNA
                              The IATTC (IATTC Res. C-23-02) and the WCPFC (Harvest Strategy 2023-01) adopted
                              a full management procedure, including a harvest control rule, in 2023, which was applied
                              for the first time in 2024 based on the latest stock assessment performed. The IATTC/
                              WCPFC management procedure is aligned and its objectives are defined as follows:
                               Maintain spawning stock biomass (SSB) above the limit reference point, with a
                                 probability of at least 80 percent over the next ten years. The risk of breaching the limit
                                 reference point based on the most current estimate of SSB shall be no greater than
                                 20 percent.
                               Maintain depletion of total biomass around historical (2006–2015) average depletion
                                 over the next ten years.
                               Maintain fishing intensity (F) at or below the target reference point with a probability
                                 of at least 50 percent over the next ten years.
                               To the extent practicable, management changes (e.g. catch and/or effort) should be
                                 relatively gradual between years.
                                 The limit reference point is set at 14 percent of the dynamic unfished SSB and the target
                              reference point at the fishing intensity (F) level that results in the stock producing 45 percent
                              of spawning potential ratio.
                              SOUTH PACIFIC ALBACORE TUNA
                              There is no management procedure adopted for South Pacific albacore tuna in either the
                              IATTC or in the WCPFC. However, various components of the management procedure,
                              such as the target reference point and limit reference point, have been adopted.
                              PACIFIC BLUEFIN TUNA
                              There is no management procedure adopted for Pacific bluefin tuna in either the IATTC
                              or in the WCPFC. However, various components of the management procedure, such as
                              the target reference point, limit reference point and a harvest control rule for its rebuilding
                              plan, have been adopted.

4.2.4 Management measures
TROPICAL TUNAS
The main binding conservation measure for bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack tuna established
by the WCPFC is CMM 2023-01. For the 2024–2027 period, it calls for:
 A one-and-a-half-month closure (July to mid-August) of fishing on FADs in EEZ waters
  and on areas beyond national jurisdiction between 20° north and 20° south.
 Extension of the FAD closure for one additional month in areas beyond national
  jurisdiction, with some exemptions for Kiribati- and Philippines-flagged vessels.
 Fully non-entangling FADs without netting in their construction.
 A limit of 350 drifting FADs at any one time per purse-seine vessel.
 A limitation on the number of vessel days in EEZs (i.e. a vessel day scheme).
 Limitation of purse-seine effort on the high seas for non-Small Islands Developing
  States (SIDS) members.
 A full-retention requirement for all purse-seine vessels regarding bigeye, skipjack and
  yellowfin tunas between 20° north and 20° south.
 Flag-specific catch limits for non-SIDS longline fleets for bigeye tuna. These catch
  limits may be increased by up to 10 percent if linked to a proportional increase of
  observer coverage (achieved by human and/or electronic monitoring).
  This conservation and management measure (CMM) is complex, with many “either/or”
choices, exemptions or exclusions and decisions yet to be made with respect to some measures,
which makes it difficult to predict the outcomes in terms of actual future catch and effort levels.
NORTH PACIFIC ALBACORE TUNA
The main binding conservation measure for North Pacific albacore tuna established by the
WCPFC is CMM 2019-03, which calls for members not to increase fishing effort for North
Pacific albacore tuna in the Convention Area north of the equator and not to increase fishing
effort directed at North Pacific albacore tuna beyond 2002–2004 annual average levels. In
the IATTC, Resolution C-05-02 calls for members not to increase fishing effort directed
at North Pacific albacore tuna beyond the “current level”.
SOUTH PACIFIC ALBACORE TUNA
The main binding conservation measure for South Pacific albacore tuna, established by the
WCPFC, is CMM 2015-02, which aims to limit fishing mortality by capping the number of
vessels fishing for South Pacific albacore tuna per Commission member, with some exemptions
for SIDS. This capacity limitation prevents the number of vessels from exceeding the 2005
level or the 2000–2004 average. The IATTC adopted Resolution C-24-04, encouraging
collaboration and alignment with the WCPFC in South Pacific albacore management.
PACIFIC BLUEFIN TUNA
WCPFC CMM 2024-01 establishes management measures to rebuild the Pacific bluefin
tuna spawning biomass to its historical median level (the median point estimate for the
1952–2014 period) by 2024 with at least 60 percent probability. This CMM limits total
fishing effort north of 20° north to below the average 2002–2004 levels. It also establishes
catch limits per member for Pacific bluefin tuna less and larger than 30 kg, and allows
members to use part of their juvenile catch limit (< 30 kg) to catch adults (> 30 kg). Members
with less than 10 tonnes of catch during 2002–2004 are allowed to increase catch up to 10
tonnes. Any overcatch or undercatch on the catch limit will be deducted from or added to
the following year’s TAC, with a maximum undercatch that can be carried over in any given
year not exceeding 17 percent of its initial annual catch limit.
   An overall combined total commercial catch limit of 12 585 tonnes for the 2025–2026
period was set by IATTC in Resolution C-24-02. IATTC Resolution C-23-01 describes
the objectives for both rebuilding periods, establishes harvest control rules for the second
rebuilding period and the subsequent period after the second objective is met, sets over-
and under-harvest limits, and calls on the Commission to collaborate with the WCPFC
Northern Committee to develop candidate reference points and harvest control rules.

Global tuna fisheries




                                                  About 11 percent of the world’s
                                                  tuna production comes from
                                                  Atlantic Ocean (AO) stocks – FAO
                                                  Major Fishing Areas 21, 27, 31,
                                                  34, 41 and 47. Catches of skipjack
                                                  tuna, yellowfin tuna, bigeye tuna, albacore tuna and bluefin tuna in
                                                  2023 totaled 544 700 tonnes, a 9 percent decrease from 2022 levels.
                                                  The total catch has generally declined since the mid-1990s, followed
                                                  by an upward trend since 2009 (FIGURE E.1.13).
                                                  The catch of tropical tunas (bigeye tuna, yellowfin tuna and skipjack) in the AO initially
                                                  steadily increased by approximately 100 000 tonnes per decade, reaching 100 000 tonnes
                                                  in 1963, 200 000 tonnes in 1971, and 300 000 tonnes in 1980. It then quickly rose to
                                                  0.4 million tonnes by 1982, before reaching 500 000 tonnes in 1994. Total catches
                                                  declined to 300 000 tonnes in 2006 but then began increasing again, reaching a
                                                  historical high of 520 000 tonnes in 2018. Since then, catches have fluctuated between
                                                  400 000 tonnes and 500 000 tonnes (FIGURE E.1.13).
                                                     Catches of temperate tunas (albacore and bluefin tuna) also steadily increased from
                                                  1950, reaching 130 000 tonnes by 1964. However, they then fluctuated between
                                                  80 000 and 125 000 tonnes until 2007 when they began to decline, reaching a historic low
                                                  of 54 000 tonnes in 2010 and a second low of 57 650 tonnes in 2014. Since then, catches
                                                  have recovered, primarily due to the resurgence of bluefin tuna and the healthy status of
                                                  North Atlantic albacore tuna. Recent catches are around 95 000 tonnes (FIGURE E.1.13).
                                                     The average tuna catch over the last five years (2019–2023) was 551 010 tonnes. During
                                                  this period, skipjack tuna accounted for 47 percent of the total catch by weight, followed
                                                  by yellowfin tuna (25 percent), bigeye tuna (11 percent), albacore tuna (10 percent) and
                                                  bluefin tuna (7 percent). Purse-seine vessels were responsible for 63 percent of the total
                                                  catch, followed by longline (15 percent), pole-and-line (11 percent) and other fishing
                                                  methods (11 percent).
                                                     Skipjack tuna catches have continuously increased to peak at 300 000 tonnes in 2018,
                                                  the highest on record, and have fluctuated between 230 000 and 290 000 million tonnes
                                                  since then. Meanwhile, the yellowfin tuna catch reached its highest level in 1990, totaling
                                                  about 200 000 tonnes, but then showed a decreasing trend until 2013, when it dropped to

130 000 tonnes. Since then, catches have increased, reaching 0.15 million tonnes in 2022
(FIGURE E.1.13). Similarly, bigeye tuna catches followed a continuous upward trend until
1994, when they peaked at 135 000 tonnes. Since then, they have declined, with recent
catches ranging between 50 000 and 60 000 tonnes over the past four years.
   Atlantic bluefin tuna catches have also shown a continuous increasing trend, reaching
a record high of 62 000 tonnes in 2007 before declining sharply to just 10 000 tonnes by
2011, when their populations were considered unsustainable. However, due to a recovery
plan, bluefin tuna stocks have rebounded, and catches increased again to 40 000 tonnes
in 2023.
   Albacore tuna catches peaked at 92 000 tonnes in 1964 and have since fluctuated between
53 000 and 85 000 tonnes until 2006, after which they declined to 40 000 tonnes in 2010.
Since then, catches have increased, and current levels are around 53 000–59 000 tonnes.

4.3.1 Catches by species
BIGEYE TUNA
Atlantic bigeye tuna catches in 2023 were about 61 300 tonnes, a 2 percent decrease
from 2022. Catches by longline, the main fishing gear (50 percent of the catch), declined
sharply between 1999 and 2006, but they have declined more slowly during the last few
years. Purse-seine and pole-and-line vessels account for about 31 percent and 10 percent
of the catches, respectively (FIGURE E.1.14).
YELLOWFIN TUNA
Yellowfin tuna catches in 2023 were about 139 500 tonnes, a 6 percent decrease from
2022. The main fishing gear is purse seining (about 68 percent of the catch) (FIGURE E.1.14).
Purse-seine catches showed a general decrease since the early 1990s but started growing
again after 2007. About 13 percent of the catch is made by longlining and 5 percent by
pole-and-line vessels.

Skipjack tuna catches in the Eastern Atlantic Ocean in 2023 were about 219 900 tonnes,
an 18 percent decrease from 2022. Purse seine (89 percent) and pole-and-line (7 percent)
dominate the catches (FIGURE E.1.14). The purse-seine catches had been decreasing from
the early 1990s to 2009, but have increased substantially since then, reaching a peak in
2018 and again in 2022. Catches by other gears have remained stable.
WESTERN SKIPJACK TUNA
Skipjack tuna catches in the Western Atlantic Ocean in 2023 were about 29 600 tonnes,
a 37 percent increase from 2022. Pole-and-line fishing dominates the catches (69 percent),
followed by purse seining (8 percent) (FIGURE E.1.14). Pole-and-line catch levels remained
relatively stable between the mid-1980s and the early 2010s, but have been much lower
in recent years after a sharp decline in the 2014–2015 period.
NORTH ATLANTIC ALBACORE TUNA
Albacore tuna catches in the North Atlantic in 2023 were about 28 200 tonnes, an
11 percent decrease from 2022 catch levels. Catches are made by a variety of fishing gears,
including pole-and-line (38 percent), trawl (27 percent), troll (19 percent) and longline
(16 percent) (FIGURE E.1.14).
SOUTH ATLANTIC ALBACORE TUNA
Albacore tuna catches in the South Atlantic in 2023 were about 22 100 tonnes
(FIGURE E.1.14), a 6 percent decrease from 2022. Catches are made primarily by longline
(78 percent) and pole-and-line (21 percent).
MEDITERRANEAN ALBACORE TUNA
Albacore tuna catches in the Mediterranean in 2023 were about 2 300 tonnes, similar to
2022 levels. Catches are highly variable and are made primarily by longline (95 percent),
with the remainder by other surface gears (FIGURE E.1.14).

                              Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna catches were subject to a high degree
Global tuna fisheries




                              of misreporting from the mid-1990s until the recent past. However, in recent years,
                              misreporting is thought to have diminished considerably. In 2023, reported catches were
                              about 39 200 tonnes (FIGURE E.1.14), a 12 percent increase from 2022. Purse seiners take
                              62 percent of the catch, followed by traps (16 percent), longlines (15 percent), and a variety
                              of surface gears including pole-and-line, handlines and trolling.
                              WESTERN BLUEFIN TUNA
                              Western Atlantic bluefin tuna catches in 2023 were about 2 600 tonnes, a 5 percent
                              decrease from 2022. Sport gears (handline, rod-and-reel) take 61 percent of the catch,
                              followed by longlines (32 percent) and other surface gears. Purse-seine catches in recent
                              years have been very minor (FIGURE E.1.14).

                              4.3.2 Stock status
                              BIGEYE TUNA
                              The last (2021) assessment conducted by the ICCAT Standing Committee on Research
                              and Statistics (SCRS) gave more optimistic results than the 2018 assessment (ICCAT,
                              2024). The SCRS indicated that while uncertainty on natural mortality was included
                              in the grid, but the uncertainty related to the longline index was not incorporated in the
                              advice, as it derived a more pessimistic stock status, which SCRS deemed unrealistic.
                              Based on combining several model-data scenarios, the stock is estimated to be over-
                              fished, but overfishing is not occurring (TABLE E.1.4 and FIGURE E.1.15).
                              YELLOWFIN TUNA
                              The most recent full assessment of yellowfin tuna was carried out in 2024 using an
                              age-structured model framework applied to the available data through 2022 (ICCAT,
                              2024). These results were more optimistic than those of the 2019 assessment and indicated
                              that the stock is not overfished and overfishing is not occurring. The estimate of MSY
                              is 121 661 tonnes, lower than in previous decades because the overall fishery selectivity
                              has shifted towards smaller yellowfin, mainly through fishing on FADs. The current catch
                              (139 500 tonnes) is above MSY and the adopted catch limit (110 000 tonnes); if this catch
                              trend continues, overfishing might occur.
                              EASTERN ATLANTIC SKIPJACK TUNA
                              The stock was last assessed in 2022, using data up to 2020 and two different model
                              platforms (ICCAT, 2024). The combined results of both assessment models, based on
                              the median of an uncertainty grid with 18 scenarios in each model, show that the stock
                              is not overfished and overfishing is not occurring.
                              WESTERN ATLANTIC SKIPJACK TUNA
                              The stock was last assessed in 2022, using data up to 2020 (ICCAT, 2024). Stock status
                              was estimated by combining the results of the nine scenarios in the uncertainty grid. It is
                              estimated that the stock is not overfished, and overfishing is not occurring.
                              NORTH ATLANTIC ALBACORE TUNA
                              The most recent assessment for the North Atlantic albacore tuna stock was conducted in
                              2023 using data up to 2021 (ICCAT, 2024). The results indicated that the stock is not
                              overfished and overfishing is not occurring.
                              SOUTH ATLANTIC ALBACORE TUNA
                              The most recent assessment for the South Atlantic stock of albacore tuna was conducted
                              in 2020, including data until 2018 (ICCAT, 2024). The results were more optimistic than
                              those in the previous assessment and the new stock assessment indicated that the stock
                              is not overfished and overfishing is not occurring.

                              MEDITERRANEAN ALBACORE TUNA
                              The Mediterranean albacore tuna stock was last assessed in 2024 using data up to 2022
Global tuna fisheries




                              (ICCAT, 2024), but there is considerable uncertainty about the accuracy of reported
                              catches, and the available indices of abundance show a limited ability to monitor stock
                              trends. In particular, uncertainty related to the larval survey index made the SCRS
                              consider two different stock status scenarios. Based on the most pessimistic scenario,
                              which was used to provide the catch management advice, the stock is considered to be
                              overfished and overfishing is occurring.
                              EASTERN ATLANTIC AND MEDITERRANEAN BLUEFIN TUNA
                              There is considerable uncertainty about its level of abundance. The last assessment in
                              2022 (ICCAT, 2024) indicated that, although the current ratio of spawning biomass
                              SSB/SSBMSY is unknown, overfishing is not occurring. Catches were reduced by over
                              70 percent in the years following 2007 due to strict limits and controls, but they have
                              been progressively increasing in recent years as the stock has recovered. Catches are now
                              ~50 percent less than the 2007 level. The existing TAC and strict controls have helped
                              end overfishing.
                              WESTERN ATLANTIC BLUEFIN TUNA
                              The last stock assessment in 2021 (ICCAT, 2024) indicated that while the current ratio
                              of spawning biomass SSB/SSBMSY is unknown, overfishing is not taking place. The
                              estimate of MSY is unknown.

4.3.3 Management procedures

BIGEYE/YELLOWFIN AND EASTERN ATLANTIC SKIPJACK TUNA
No management procedure has been adopted, however, ICCAT has started a process for
developing a multiespecies management strategy evaluation for the three tropical tuna
species. Interim operational management objectives are not yet defined, but have been
suggested for consideration when developing a management procedure for these species
(ICCAT Res 24-02).
WESTERN ATLANTIC SKIPJACK TUNA
In 2024, ICCAT adopted candidate management procedures for Western Atlantic
skipjack tuna to achieve agreed management objectives. It tasked the SCRS with testing
these candidate procedures, allowing the Commission to adopt the final management
procedures in 2025 to set the TAC for the 2026–2028 period.

                              lished by the ICCAT is Recommendation 24-01. This multi-annual management plan
                              for tropical tunas for 2025–2027 calls for:
                               A TAC of 73 011 tonnes in 2025 for bigeye tuna, with catch limits established for
                                members; for the 2026–2027 period the TAC will be maintained provided the
                                2025 stock assessment indicates a 65 percent or larger probability of the stock being
                                in the green zone in 2034.
                               An overall TAC of 110 000 tonnes for yellowfin tuna (unallocated by country) for
                                the 2025–2027 period.
                               A 45-day closure (17 March to 30 April) in 2025 for purse-seine and baitboat
                                (pole-and-line) vessels fishing on floating objects (including their support vessels’
                                activities) on the high seas and EEZs. In addition, a prohibition on deploying
                                drifting FADs during the 15 days prior to the closure.
                               Observer coverage (human or electronic) of 100 percent for purse-seine vessels and
                                10 percent for large longline vessels.
                               A limit of 300 FADs with operational buoys at any one time per vessel in 2025,
                                which will be reduced to 288 FADs in 2026–2027.
                               Fully non-entangling FADs constructed without netting.

NORTH ATLANTIC ALBACORE TUNA
In 2023, as a result of applying the management procedure, an annual TAC of 47 251
tonnes was established for 2024–2026 (ICCAT Rec 23-05). The TAC for 2024–2026
represents a 25 percent increase with respect to the previous TAC in the 2021–23 period
and is above the MSY estimate for this stock (42 000 tonnes) because the current biomass
is well above BMSY. The management procedure will be applied again in 2026.
   Additionally, the multi-annual management programme established by ICCAT for
North Atlantic albacore tuna calls for a limit on the number of vessels from each member
targeting North Atlantic albacore tuna to its average level of the 1993–1995 period.
EASTERN ATLANTIC AND MEDITERRANEAN BLUEFIN TUNA
The Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna stock has been subject to a
rebuilding programme since 2006 (ICCAT Rec. 06-05). In 2022, ICCAT (Rec. 22-08,
which was amended by Rec. 24-05), moved from that rebuilding plan to a management
plan. And in 2023 ICCAT adopted a management procedure for the stock (ICCAT
Rec. 23-07).
   The management plan set up in Rec. 24-05 is very comprehensive and combines
multiple conservation and compliance elements. Using the results of the management
procedure, the annual TAC for the 2023–2025 period is set at 40 570 tonnes. In addition
to the TACs, the plan includes the following measures, among others:
 Manages fishing capacity and farming capacity.
 Establishes closed fishing seasons for large-scale longliners (seven months closed
    season) and purse seiners (11 month closed season), and requires contracting parties
    or cooperating non-contracting parties (CPCs) to provide information on closed
    fishing seasons for other vessel types in their annual fishing plans.
 Sets minimum sizes of 8 kg and 30 kg (75 cm and 115 cm, respectively), depending
    on the fishery.
 Introduces bycatch limits on bluefin tuna.
 Establishes records of authorized fishing vessels, authorized traps and authorized
    farming facilities.
 Requires that CPCs establish annual farming management plans.
 Establishes provision for recreational and sport fisheries, requiring CPCs to
    regulate those fisheries.
 Establishes an observer programme with 100 percent coverage for purse seiners, for
    transfers to cages and operations in tuna farms, for operations from traps, and of
    towing vessels.
 Establishes an observer programme with 20 percent coverage for active pelagic
    trawlers, longline vessels and baitboats (all over 15 m).
  The multiple amendments made to the management plan since 2006 have resulted in
increasingly tighter controls of the actual catches. Combined with lower quotas, fishing
mortality rates have been reduced substantially.
WESTERN ATLANTIC BLUEFIN TUNA
Western Atlantic bluefin tuna has been the subject of a rebuilding programme since 1998,
which has been amended every other year since 2002. Recommendation 2022-10 sets up
a conservation and management plan starting in 2023, that includes the establishment of
TACs based on the application of the bluefin tuna management procedure (Rec. 23-07).
The annual TAC set for the 2023–2025 period is 2 726 tonnes, allocated by country in
Rec. 2022-10. This conservation and management plan also includes a 30-kg minimum
size and the prohibition of directed fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico (the only known
spawning area for the stock).

                              About 23 percent of the world’s
                              tuna production comes from
                              the Indian Ocean (IO)– FAO

                              Ocean. Catches of skipjack, yellowfin, bigeye and albacore tuna in 2023
                              totaled approximately 1 237 000 tonnes, a 1 percent decrease from
                              2022. The total catch generally declined after 2005, when a record
                              1.25 million tonnes were caught, followed by an increase in recent years
                              which has brought catches back to 2005 levels (FIGURE E.1.16). Catches of
                              southern bluefin tuna occur primarily in the IO Area of Competence.
                              However, due to their distribution across three oceans, this stock is
                              covered below under a separate section on the CCSBT convention area.
                              The catch of tropical tunas and albacore tuna in the IO steadily increased, reaching
                              200 000 tonnes in the early 1980s. It then rose rapidly to 500 000 tonnes in 1988 with the
                              advent of the purse-seine fishery in the mid-1980s. Catches continued increasing quickly,
                              reaching 600 000 tonnes in 1991, 700 000 tonnes in 1992, 800 000 tonnes in 1993,
                              900 000 tonnes in 1999, and 1.0 million tonnes in 2002. The highest recorded catch of
                              1.25 million tonnes was reached in 2005. Since then, catches declined until 2015 but have
                              increased again, returning to 2005 levels in recent years (2022 and 2023) (FIGURE E.1.16).
                                 The average tuna catch over the last five-year period (2019–2023) was 1 181 710 tonnes.
                              During this period, skipjack tuna accounted for 53 percent of the total catch by weight,
                              followed by yellowfin tuna (36 percent), bigeye tuna (8 percent) and albacore tuna
                              (3 percent). Purse-seine vessels caught 42 percent of the total catch, followed by other fish-
                              ing gears including handlines, trolling lines, coastal drifting longlines, and all other fishing
                              gears used in coastal areas (22 percent), gillnets (15 percent), pole-and-line (12 percent),
                              and longlines (9 percent).
                                 Skipjack tuna catches continuously increased, peaking at around 0.6 million tonnes in
                              2006, then declined before rising again in 2016. They reached a record high of 0.69 million
                              tonnes in 2023. Meanwhile, the yellowfin tuna catch reached its highest level in 2004,
                              totaling about 0.54 million tonnes. Since then, catches have declined, stabilizing at about
                              0.4–0.45 million tonnes over the last ten years (FIGURE E.1.16). Bigeye tuna has a similar
                              catch history to yellowfin tuna, with catches increasing until reaching a record high of
                              137 000 tonnes in 2004, followed by a decline. However, albacore tuna exhibited different
                              trends, peaking in 2013 at 50 000 tonnes and then fluctuating between 35 000 tonnes and
                              48 000 tonnes.

4.4.1 Catches by species

BIGEYE TUNA
Bigeye tuna catches in 2023 were about 105 877 tonnes, a 17 percent increase from 2022.
For the period 2019–2023, the main fishing gear is purse seine (43 percent), followed by
longline (37 percent). Longline catches have declined dramatically from a high in 2004
(FIGURE E.1.17), due to vessels moving away from the main fishing grounds to avoid piracy,
though they increased sharply in 2012 only to decrease again since then. In contrast,
catches from purse-seine vessels have been relatively stable since 2000, with the exception
of 2018 and 2021–2023 during which catches were elevated: the catch in 2023 is the
highest in the record (52 000 tonnes).
YELLOWFIN TUNA
Yellowfin tuna catches in 2023 were about 401 364 tonnes, an 8 percent decrease from
2022. The main fishing gears for yellowfin tuna for the 2019–2023 period are purse seine
(30 percent of the catch), followed by handlines (27 percent), gillnets (15 percent), other
line fisheries such as troll and coastal longline (15 percent), longline (9 percent) and pole-
and-line (3 percent) (FIGURE E.1.17). Catches by gillnet (15 percent) and miscellaneous line
gears (42 percent including handline, troll and coastal longline) have become increasingly
important in recent years. Catches by these gears are poorly estimated. Catches from
pole-and-line vessels (3 percent) have been relatively stable. Overall, catches have declined
by 26 percent from a record high of 540 000 tonnes in 2004; but annual catches have
stayed above 400 000 tonnes since 2012, and another peak of over 450 000 tonnes was
reached in 2018–2019.
SKIPJACK TUNA
Skipjack tuna catches in the IO in 2023 were about 688 679 tonnes, a 2 percent
increase from 2022. Purse seine (54 percent), pole-and-line (20 percent) and gillnets
(17 percent) dominate the catches, with other miscellaneous gears catching around
9 percent (FIGURE E.1.17). Pole-and-line, purse-seine and gillnet catches decreased since
the mid-2000s for about a decade, but show an increasing trend after 2012, notably so
for purse seine.
ALBACORE TUNA
Albacore tuna catches in the IO in 2023 were about 41 680 tonnes, a 15 percent decrease
from 2022. Almost all catches are made by pelagic longlines (83 percent) while the
contribution of other miscellaneous gears is around 17 percent (FIGURE E.1.17).

                                                    BIGEYE TUNA
                                                    The latest assessment conducted by the Scientific Committee in 2022 (IOTC, 2024)
                                                    indicated that the stock is overfished and overfishing is taking place (TABLE E.1.5 and
                                                    FIGURE E.1.18). The 2022 and 2023 catch (both around 100 000 tonnes) were above the
                                                    MSY level and above the TAC for 2024–2025 (80 583 tonnes).
                                                    YELLOWFIN TUNA
                                                    In 2024 a new stock assessment was carried out for yellowfin tuna in the IOTC area of
                                                    competence which resulted in a more optimistic stock status than the 2021 model (IOTC,
                                                    2024). This was mostly due to the new abundance index derived from the joint catch per
                                                    unit effort (CPUE) estimated for longline fleets which was significantly different from
                                                    the index used in 2021, suggesting a marked increase of abundance for yellowfin in the
                                                    last three years (2021–2023). The new stock assessment indicated that the stock is not
                                                    overfished and overfishing is not occurring. According to the 2024 assessment, the
                                                    total catch has remained within the estimated range of MSY since 2007 (i.e. between
                                                    402 000 tonnes and 427 000 tonnes), with the exception of 2018 (443 252 tonnes)
                                                    and 2019 (450 586 tonnes), the latter being the largest catch since 2006 and above the
                                                    estimated recent MSY value. However, there is considerable uncertainty related to the
                                                    new CPUE that requires further exploration.
                                                    SKIPJACK TUNA
                                                    The most recent stock assessment of skipjack tuna was conducted in 2023 (IOTC, 2024)
                                                    and indicated that the stock is not overfished and overfishing is not occurring. The
                                                    catch in 2023 (688 680 tonnes) was larger than the estimated median value of MSY
                                                    (584 800 tonnes); if this catch trend continues, overfishing might occur.

ALBACORE TUNA
The latest assessment was performed in 2022 (IOTC, 2024) and indicated that the stock
is not overfished and overfishing is not occurring. However, there is considerable
uncertainty associated with the latest stock assessment.

                              Indian Ocean bigeye tuna is managed by a management procedure (IOTC Res 22/03)
                              with the objective of maintaining the stock with 60 percent probability in the green
                              zone of the Kobe plot while maximizing the average catch from the fishery and reducing
                              the variation in the TAC between management periods (15 percent TAC change limit).

                              The skipjack tuna in the IO is managed through a management procedure (IOTC Res
                              24/07) with the objective to have at least 50 percent probability that the spawning stock
                              biomass achieves the target biomass level of 40 percent SSB 0 by 2034–2038, is maintained
                              above the biomass of SSBMSY with very high probability, is maintained above the biomass
                              of 20 percent of SSB 0 at all times, and a maximum increase in TAC of 15 percent and a
                              maximum decrease of 10 percent relative to the previous TAC.

                              BIGEYE TUNA
                              The only conservation measure established by the IOTC specifically for bigeye tuna is
                              Resolution 23/04, which establishes catch limits by contracting parties or cooperating
                              non-contracting parties (CPCs) as per the management procedure (Res. 22/03) and
                              Resolution 01/06 concerning IOTC bigeye tuna statistical document programme.
                              YELLOWFIN TUNA
                              Resolution 21/01 establishes an interim plan for rebuilding the IO yellowfin tuna stock
                              in the IOTC area of competence. This plan details yellowfin tuna catch limits and provi-
                              sions, requiring that CPCs whose fleets exceed their catch limits will have that overcatch
                              deducted from their annual limits in future years. Moreover, Resolution 21/01 requests
                              CPCs to gradually reduce supply vessels by 31 December 2022, which also affects the
                              management of bigeye and skipjack tuna.

                              The annual skipjack tuna catch limit for the 2024–2026 period was established in
                              IOTC Circular 2024-11 applying the skipjack tuna harvest control rule specified in
                              Resolution 21/03, which has been amended by IOTC Res 24/07. The new management
                              procedure will be used to establish the catch limits for the 2027–2029 period.

TROPICAL TUNAS
In addition to the species-specific management measures above, there are other IOTC
resolutions affecting the three tropical tunas, which are described below:
 Resolution 24/06 establishes a ban on discards of bigeye, skipjack and yellowfin
    tuna by purse-seine vessels.
 Resolution 24/02 establishes procedures on a FAD management plan, including:

    ■ An IOTC-wide FAD register effective as of 1 January 2026.
    ■ A limit of 250 instrumented buoys at sea at any one time per vessel from 1 January
      2026 (225 from 1 January 2028) and a limit of 400 instrumented buoys to be
      acquired annually by each fishing vessel.
    ■ A requirement to report daily information on all active drifting fish aggregating
      devices (DFADs) to the IOTC with a time delay of 30 to 60 days.
    ■ Ban, prevention and reporting measures for abandoned, lost or otherwise
      discarded DFADs.
    ■ A requirement to use non-entangling FADs constructed without netting material
      and remove from the water all traditional FADs encountered
      (e.g. those made of entangling materials or designs).
    ■ A stepwise timeline for a fleet-wide transition to the use of biodegradable FADs
      between 1 January 2026 and 1 January 2030.
    ■ A DFAD marking scheme requires that the instrumented buoys attached to
      deployed DFADs are permanently marked with a unique reference number
      marking and the IOTC unique vessel identifier.
    ■ A timeline to reduce supply vessels in tropical tuna purse-seine operations.

Global tuna fisheries




                              AREA

                              Southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus
                              maccoyii) is assessed and
                              managed by the Commission for
                              the Conservation of Southern
                              Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT). Practically all of the catches are made in the IOTC,
                              ICCAT and WCPFC convention areas (62 percent in the Indian Ocean,
                              25 percent in the Pacific Ocean and 13 percent in the Atlantic Ocean).

                              4.5.1 Catch of southern bluefin tuna
                              Southern bluefin tuna catches in 2023 were approximately 17 300 tonnes, reflecting a
                              1 percent increase from 2022. Catches rose sharply from the beginning of the fishery
                              around 1950, reaching a record high of 81 000 tonnes in 1961. However, they then
                              declined continuously until 2011, when the lowest recorded catch of 9 459 tonnes was
                              reported (FIGURE E.1.19). Since then, catches have been gradually increasing to the current
                              level of 17 300 tonnes, largely due to strict catch limits established under the Southern
                              Bluefin Tuna Management Procedure. This procedure, initially known as the “Bali
                              Procedure” (adopted in 2011), was replaced by the “Cape Town Procedure” in 2019.
                                 Virtually all catches are made using longline (70 percent) and purse-seine (28 percent)
                              fishing methods. Current catch levels are approximately 20 percent of the peak recorded
                              in 1961 (FIGURE E.1.19).

                              The latest full stock assessment was conducted in 2023 (CCSBT, 2023). Since 2017,
                              CCSBT has measured reproductive capacity as total reproductive output (TRO) rather
                              than SSB. The 2023 stock assessment suggested that the southern bluefin tuna TRO
                              is at 23 percent of its initial value as well as below the level that could produce maxi-
                              mum sustainable yield. According to the 2023 assessment, the current ratio of TRO/
                              TROMSY is estimated at 0.85, indicating that the stock is in an overfished state. The ratio of
                              Fcurrent/FMSY is estimated at 0.46, indicating that overfishing is not occurring. The estimate
                              of MSY is 30 648 tonnes, well above current catch levels (20 647 tonnes in 2024). Thus,
                              the stock is overfished and overfishing is not occurring (TABLE E.1.6 and FIGURE E.1.20).

4.5.3 Management procedures
The southern bluefin tuna is managed through a management procedure adopted in
2011 (the Bali Procedure) and renewed in 2019 (the Cape Town Procedure). This guides
the setting of TACs with the objective of achieving 20 percent of the unfished biomass
(20 percent TRO0) with a 70 percent probability by 2035 and 30 percent TRO with a
50 percent probability by 2035. Additionally, if a change to the TAC is recommended, it
is subject to a minimum change of 100 tonnes and a maximum change of 3 000 tonnes
in either direction.
4.5.4 Management measures
TACs under the management procedure are set for three-year periods to keep the stock
on its planned rebuilding trajectory. The management procedure specifies the minimum
and maximum permissible changes in TAC (either an increase or decrease, depending on
stock status relative to the rebuilding trajectory). The management procedure was applied

                              in 2022 and recommended that the TAC for the 2024–2026 period be increased by the

                              maximum allowable TAC change of 3 000 tonnes (from 17 647 to 20 647 tonnes). The
                              2024 ESC found no evidence of exceptional circumstances and therefore confirmed
                              the TAC recommendation for the 2024–2026 period of 20 647 tonnes/year, which the
                              Commission endorsed.

                              5. CONCLUDING REMARKS
                              Globally, the seven major commercial oceanic tuna species are assessed and managed as 23
                              distinct stocks by the five tuna Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs):
                              CCSBT, IATTC, ICCAT, IOTC and WCPFC. These stocks include six albacore, four
                              bigeye, four bluefin, five skipjack, and four yellowfin tuna stocks.
                                 The global tuna catch has remained stable at around 5 million tonnes in recent years. In
                              2023, the total catch was approximately 5.2 million tonnes, a figure similar to the previ-
                              ous year. Skipjack tuna accounted for the largest share (57 percent), followed by yellowfin
                              tuna (31 percent), bigeye tuna (7 percent), albacore tuna (4 percent), and the three bluefin
                              tuna species collectively contributing just 1 percent of the total catch.
                                 From a stock perspective, based on the most recent stock status adopted by tuna
                              RFMOs, 16 out of the 23 assessed tuna stocks are not overfished, and overfishing is
                              not occurring. Additionally, five stocks are classified as overfished but are not currently
                              subject to overfishing, indicating they are in a rebuilding phase. Meanwhile, two stocks
                              remain both overfished and subject to ongoing overfishing: Indian Ocean bigeye tuna and
                              Mediterranean albacore tuna. Encouragingly, 95 percent of the total global tuna catch orig-
                              inates from stocks that are not overfished and where overfishing is not occurring. This is
                              largely due to the healthy status of skipjack tuna stocks, which contribute more than half
                              of the total tuna catch. It should be noted that FAO uses different criteria to determine
                              fish stock status, which may result in discrepancies between RFMOs’ assessments and the
                              FAO assessment, as shown in the population-specific stock status tables.
                                 Since the adoption of the first management procedure for southern bluefin tuna in
                              2011, several other tuna stocks have also implemented them, which has contributed to
                              both rebuilding depleted stocks and maintaining the health of existing ones (BOX E.1.2).
                              Additionally, ongoing management strategy evaluation processes are in place to develop
                              and adopt new management procedures for remaining tuna stocks, ensuring their long-
                              term sustainability.
                                 The estimated MSY for all 23 commercial tuna stocks is approximately 6.3 million
                              tonnes. Stocks of bigeye, yellowfin, bluefin and albacore tuna are being fished at levels
                              consistent with MSY, while skipjack tuna could potentially sustain slightly higher yields,
                              particularly in the WCPFC region. However, in the WCPFC, which accounts for the
                              main difference between total catch and potential MSY (approximately 1 million tonnes),
                              a target reference point and a management procedure for skipjack tuna have already been
                              established. Fishing in this region is occurring at the defined sustainable level, meaning
                              further increases in skipjack tuna catches are not feasible under current management.
                              Moreover, because skipjack tuna fishing globally is primarily conducted using FADs,
                              and the tropical tuna fisheries is multispecies in nature, an increase in skipjack tuna catch
                              would inevitably result in higher catches of bigeye and yellowfin tuna stocks globally,
                              which could negatively impact these species.
                                 In conclusion, the current scenario suggests a management focus that maintains yields
                              and catches rather than expanding them. Under existing management frameworks, the
                              global tuna fishery appears to have reached or is close to reaching its maximum, and
                              further increases in catch are not advisable. Instead, efforts should continue to focus on
                              strengthening management measures, where required, through adopting management
                              procedures, maintaining stock health, and ensuring the long-term sustainability of tuna
                              populations.

BOX E.1.1
MAJOR COMMERCIAL TUNA SPECIES BIOLOGY AND STOCK INFORMATION
There are three species of bluefin tuna, and one each of albacore, bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack tuna. Due to differences in their
distributions and the different fisheries that exploit them, the species are classified as “temperate” or “tropical”. The temperate
tunas are the bluefin, plus albacores tuna; they are found in waters as cold as 10 °C, but can also be found in tropical waters.
Skipjack and yellowfin tuna are classified as tropical and are found in waters with temperatures greater than 18 °C (although
they can dive in colder waters). Although bigeye tuna could be classified as being between both groups, it is mostly treated as a
tropical species by tuna RFMOs.

DEEP-SEA FISHERIES
IN AREAS BEYOND NATIONAL JURISDICTION

Anthony B. Thompson
Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations


1. OVERVIEW
The ocean and the seabed are politically divided into various maritime zones, each with its
applicable jurisdictional regime, pursuant to customary international law and the United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS, 1982). Beyond the territorial base-
line and the territorial sea, a single coastal state can normally claim or have jurisdiction
over two large main maritime zones, namely the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) which
can extend to a maximum of 200 nautical miles (nm) from the territorial baseline, and
the seabed and subsoil thereof extending to the outer extent of the continental shelf. The
continental shelf can extend beyond the 200 nm EEZ or otherwise to the outer limit of
the EEZ where the outer edge of the continental margin is less than the 200 nm. The
water column beyond the EEZ and the outer edge of a coastal state’s continental shelf
constitutes a marine area beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ).
   Flagged vessels that operate in ABNJ are subject only to the jurisdiction of their
respective flag states (FIGURE E.2.1; UNCLOS, 1982). These vessels, however, still need to
meet international requirements for sustainability in ABNJ. In most areas, ensuring and
monitoring compliance of these vessels with applicable international laws and standards
is a cooperative effort made by the states concerned, either directly or through regional
fisheries management organizations (RFMOs) that serve as fora for scientific delibera-
tions and management decisions.

                                   al. (2009) and FAO (2020), and only a summary is presented in this chapter.

                                   2. INTRODUCTION
                                   Deep-sea fisheries are generally regarded as those fisheries where the total catch includes
                                   species that can only sustain low exploitation rates and that deploy gears that are likely to
                                   contact the seafloor during the normal course of fishing operations (FAO, 2009). In ABNJ,
                                   these fisheries catch demersal species with bottom trawls and bottom-set gillnets, longlines,
                                   pots and traps typically in depths of 200–2 000 m, but occasionally shallower or deeper.
                                   Deep-sea fisheries in ABNJ tend to occur on topographical features, such as continental
                                   shelves, steep slopes, ridges, canyons and seamounts. The methods used are similar to those
                                   for deep-sea fishing within EEZs, though fishing at great depths invariably requires specialist
                                   equipment. This is especially true for trawl fishing on seamounts, where smaller bottom
                                   or deep (semi-pelagic) midwater trawls are deployed in a highly targeted manner along
                                   well-defined tow lanes where bottom contact may be limited to less than 15 minutes. These
                                   fishing methods require large vessels that must carry considerable lengths of wire or warp
                                   to get the gear down to fishable depths and be able to withstand the roughest of weather.
                                   Many of these fisheries also occur far from vessels’ home ports, and land their catch in foreign
                                   ports. For these reasons, deep-sea fisheries are operated by developed country fishing nations
                                   (although they may employ crew from developing countries), and only very rarely by smaller
                                   or artisanal fleets from developing nations (FAO, 2011, 2020).
                                      Deep-sea species, and especially mesopelagic species that migrate between deep and
                                   more shallow waters, are a key part of the biological carbon cycle.
                                   2.1 ABNJ and topography
                                   ABNJ have variable depths, bottom topographies, and productivity. The continental shelf
                                   is the extension from the land into the ocean, which can be fairly shallow, sloping gently
                                   down to a depth of a few hundred metres. The extent of the shelf can range from tens of
                                   nautical miles in most places to more than 200 nm in others. The main extended conti-
                                   nental shelf regions are in the North Atlantic and Barents Sea, the Antarctic Area, the
                                   Saya de Malha Bank in the Indian Ocean, and the shelf around the Arctic Ocean which
                                   is currently (still) largely ice-covered, along with a few other areas. The continental shelves
                                   are often hospitable to biodiversity, as sunlight penetrates at shallow depths, supporting
                                   abundant plant and animal life. Canyons frequently cut into the continental shelves, and
                                   they may have steep rocky slopes. Canyons can be quite productive owing to the water
                                   currents that sweep through them being rich in nutrients and oxygen. Many canyons
                                   have dense concentrations of deepwater corals, sponges and other sedentary organisms.
                                       The outer edge of the continental shelf descends rapidly down to 3 000 m or more, form-
                                   ing deep abyssal plains. Life at these great depths is very different, and productivity is very
                                   low without light and usually little oxygen. However, the underwater features that rise up
                                   at places from the abyssal seafloor provide a more productive environment. Best-known
                                   of these features are the underwater volcanoes (also known as seamounts), the mid-ocean
                                   ridges, and the seeps and vents with their chemosynthetic life forms. These deep-sea land-
                                   scape features and the fisheries they support are very diverse, depending on which part of
                                   the globe they happen to occur in as well as other factors. Seamounts and ridges dominate
                                   the North and South Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, South Atlantic and the Antarctic Area.
                                   The North Atlantic has many canyons, whereas the Mediterranean has a mix of very diverse
                                   deep-sea ecosystems that include the full range of the features mentioned above.
                                   2.2 Fisheries in ABNJ
                                   The data on deep-sea fisheries in ABNJ has not been well documented, mainly because
                                   there was not that much global interest in monitoring and controlling activities in ABNJ
                                   until after the various Earth Summits were held, especially from 1992 onwards (Agenda 21,
                                   1992). Early deep-sea fishing had started by the beginning of the nineteenth century using
                                   sailing vessels. Power and efficiency greatly increased with the invention of steam-powered

trawlers at the end of the nineteenth century. Trawlers were capable of deploying larger trawl
fishing gear. Deep-sea trawling underwent a major expansion from the 1950s to the 1980s,
particularly in more remote areas further offshore in what is now ABNJ. Unable to sustain
high catches, and with concerns over ecological damage increasing, the deep-sea fishing
industry has been generally contracting since the end of the twentieth century (FAO, 2020).
   From the 1960s to the 2000s, the states most involved in distant-water fishing on deep-
sea demersal species were the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR, which became
the Russian Federation), Spain, Japan, Poland, Portugal and Germany (TABLE E.2.1), landing
an estimated 1 million tonnes annually (author’s estimates based on data publicly available
from relevant RFMOs). Fleets moved to target emerging resources, and in the absence of
regulation some were subject to overfishing. A recent example are the Indian Ocean orange
roughy (Hoplostethos atlanticus) and alfonsino (Beryx decadactylus) stocks targeted around
the turn of the century. The fishery started around 1997 and by 2001 there were upwards
of 35 vessels and catches of around 35 000 tonnes. The fleet and catches dropped in 2002
to fewer than 10 vessels and catches under 10 000 tonnes (SIOFA, 2016). Today, there are
only a few vessels and catches of around 5 000 tonnes (SIOFA, 2024).

  BRIEF HISTORY OF THE EARLY DEVELOPMENT OF ABNJ FISHERIES

 Region             History
 Northwest          1904–1920s: French trawlers targeting cod on the tail of the Grand Bank. (Fisheries closer to
 Atlantic           land, in current EEZs, started much earlier.) Continual expansion through the 1990s, by vessels
                    from Europe and the Russian Federation, leading to stock and fisheries reductions.

 Northeast          1905: Deep trawling on continental shelf west of Ireland.
 Atlantic           1920s: Trawling for deep-living, slow-growing redfish in Barents Sea.
                    1960–1970s: USSR expansion into deep water of Northeast Atlantic,
                    followed later by European fleets.

 Central            Almost no fisheries resources in ABNJ area of the Central Atlantic.
 Atlantic           1839: Deep line-fishing for black scabbard off Azores (likely in current EEZ).
                    1900: Trawling for European hake off Morocco (also likely in current EEZ).
                    1960s: Sporadic deep mid-water and bottom trawling on western (Corner Rise seamounts)
                    and eastern side for alfonsino, by the USSR.

 Southwest          Current stocks in ABNJ are a small extension of the vast EEZ stocks.
 Atlantic           Many distant-water fleets have exploited these, but their history is uncertain.

 Southeast          Early history is uncertain.
 Atlantic           1990s: Bottom trawling for alfonsino, pelagic armourhead and orange roughy.

 Mediterranean      Deeper fisheries for European hake with various gears likely developed early.
 Sea                1930s: Deepwater blue and red shrimp in western basin.
                    1990s: Giant red shrimp fishery in eastern basin.

 North Pacific      1960s: USSR seamount fisheries along Emperor-Hawaiian seamount chain.
                    Japan started trawling here later.
                    1980s: Expansion of mid-water trawl fisheries for Alaska pollock in the Bering Sea.

 South Pacific      1980s: Trawling on seamounts by the USSRand Japan.

 Antarctic area     1960s: Fishing for demersal fish (most of it reported as marine fishes nei, MZZ) by the USSR (FAO,
                    2024).
                    1970s: Trawling for krill by the USSR and Japan.

Deep-sea fisheries in ABNJ



                                            2.3 Fisheries management in ABNJ
                                            The management of fisheries in ABNJ has changed dramatically over the years. The
                                            International Whaling Commission was established in 1946 and was the first interna-
                                            tional body to start undertaking scientific research and management decisions relating to
                                            a marine living resource in ABNJ; in some ways, it was a precursor to the species-specific
                                            RFMOs. Prior to the entry into force of UNCLOS in 1994, there were no clear fisheries
                                            management responsibilities in ABNJ. Consequently, flag states – those with fishing
                                            vessels registered and flying their respective flag – operating in the ABNJ did not have to
                                            meet any international obligations controlling what, where and how their vessels fished
                                            in such areas.
                                               There was almost no information collected on fishing activities in ABNJ. This prob-
                                            lematic situation began to change when states agreed on adopting two key legally binding

instruments that required their cooperation for the management and conservation
of marine living resources in ABNJ. The first was UNCLOS, which was adopted in
1982, entered into force in 1994, and has 170 Parties (as of March 2025). The second
was the Agreement for the implementation of the UNCLOS provisions relating to
the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish
stocks (UNFSA, 1995), which was adopted in 1995, entered into force in 2001, and has
93 Parties (as of March 2025).
   The two instruments set out flag states’ responsibility over the vessels flying their flag,
including the exercise of effective jurisdiction and control (Kuemlangan et al., 2023).
Specifically, the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement (UNFSA) requires Parties to
adopt management and conservation measures for the stocks concerned based on the
best scientific evidence available, the precautionary approach and the need to protect
biodiversity, and taking into account the interests of artisanal and subsistence fishers.
Another important instrument for the management and conservation of ABNJ fisher-
ies is the FAO Agreement to promote compliance with international conservation and
management measures by fishing vessels on the high seas (Compliance Agreement). This
was adopted in 1993, entered into force in 2003, and currently has 45 Parties (as of March
2025). The Agreement requires Parties to ensure that vessels flying their flag comply with
applicable conservation and management measures on the high seas.
   Management of fisheries stocks in ABNJ, where possible, is intended to be coordi-
nated through RFMOs. These organizations act as fora for adopting legally-binding
conservation and management measures that principally set and control the amount of
catch of, and/or effort on, the target species to ensure sustainability (as defined by the
regional body). In the early 2000s, biodiversity conservation became a global concern,
and with the help of various United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Resolutions
(e.g. Resolutions 59/25, 61/105), management measures were adopted to reduce impacts
and protect biodiversity (FAO, 2009). Fisheries, and particularly bottom fisheries, under-
went an enormous transformation, and much of ABNJ came under stricter management
control (FIGURE E.2.2).
   In 2023, the Agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea
on Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas beyond
National Jurisdiction (BBNJ Agreement) was finally adopted. This marked an impor-
tant milestone in the governance of oceans, conservation and sustainable use of marine
biological diversity. This Agreement offers an opportunity to strengthen existing policy
instruments and processes, and enhance the coordination and cooperation efforts among
sectoral bodies, without undermining their mandates or the progress already achieved. It
will enter into force once 60 countries have officially ratified or acceded to it. As of April
2025, the BBNJ Agreement has 113 signatories and 21 Parties.

3. FISHERY PROFILES
The FAO Deep-sea Fisheries Guidelines (FAO, 2009) states that deep-sea fisheries can be
described as “the total catch (everything brought up by the gear)”, includes species that can
only sustain low exploitation rates, and it applies to fishing gear that is likely to contact
the seafloor during the normal course of fishing operations. It further notes that deep-sea
fisheries have “specific challenges for their sustainable utilization and exploitation”. These
include: (i) maturation at relatively old ages; (ii) slow growth; (iii) long life expectancies;
(iv) low natural mortality rates; (v) intermittent recruitment of successful year classes;
and (vi) spawning that may not occur every year (TABLE E.2.2). Indeed, some deep-sea
species have very low productivity which can only withstand low exploitation rates, such
as the iconic seamount species orange roughy, and are easily overfished. Others are more
productive, such as cod, and can withstand modest exploitation levels.

                                      The fisheries in ABNJ vary greatly according to the region fished, and many are exten-
                                   sions of similar fisheries occurring in deeper EEZ waters; they can broadly be divided into:
                                   3.1 Deeper continental shelf/slope fisheries
                                   These occur on both sides of the North Atlantic, targeting species such as gadoids,
                                   Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis)
                                   and demersal redfish (Sebastes spp.); in the Southwest Atlantic targeting species such as
                                   Argentine hake (Merluccius hubbsi); and in the South Pacific targeting hapuku (Polyprion
                                   oxygeneios) and orange roughy. These fisheries are usually undertaken with bottom or
                                   deep-midwater trawls, but can include gillnets, longlines etc. Many of these have been
                                   operating since the 1920s, with the advent of steam trawlers, and have a long history of
                                   exploitation. These fisheries can also have significant bycatches of deepwater sharks, which
                                   is a cause for concern.
                                   3.2 Seamount fisheries
                                   These operate on the underwater volcanic features that rise from abyssal plains to fishable
                                   depths, typically with peaks at a maximum depth of 1 500 m, but they can be deeper.
                                   They are characterized by especially long-lived low-productivity species such as orange
                                   roughy, alfonsino and armourhead. These species once formed large shoals of older fish
                                   that ceased to reproduce. Initial catches were poorly documented, but they were huge
                                   compared to present-day catches. Uncontrolled fishing effort decimated these stocks in
                                   just a few years; there was no fisheries management from 1970s to 1990s. A large reduction
                                   in stock size was inevitable, even under a modest fishing pressure, which would be desir-
                                   able if the goal was to increase the productivity of the stock at a sustainable exploitation
                                   rate. Instead, these early fisheries pushed many stocks well beyond sustainability levels.
                                   Remnant seamount fisheries exist today and are more sustainably harvested. They require
                                   specialized fishing techniques using highly targeted smaller mid-water or bottom trawls
                                   and sophisticated acoustic fish finders; this is especially true now that the stocks are harder
                                   to find. Similar fisheries to those on seamounts occur on some ridges and occasionally in
                                   canyons. These fisheries have been found in the North and South Pacific, Indian Ocean,
                                   and to a much lesser extent in the northwestern and northeastern Atlantic.

3.3 Deep longline fisheries in the Antarctic Area
These specialize in targeting toothfish and can go to depths of 2 300 m. The seafloor is
usually rocky, consisting of ridges and seamounts, and bottom trawling has been banned
since 2006 in the ABNJ area of this ocean (as well as the use of longlines for toothfish
at depths shallower than 550 m), both to protect fish resources and vulnerable benthic
habitats. A similar fishery using pots and longlines occurs for sablefish (Anoplopoma
fimbria) in the northeast Pacific. Deep longline fisheries targeting toothfish also occur
in the southern parts of the Indian Ocean, South Pacific and South Atlantic, usually on
straddling stocks with the Antarctic area. The longline fishery in the southern Indian
Ocean can have a significant bycatch of deepwater sharks.
   There are many other fisheries in ABNJ, including the small pelagic fisheries
using mainly mid-water trawls to catch mackerel (Scomber scombrus), blue whiting
(Micromesistius poutassou), Pacific saury (Cololabis saira), chub mackerel (Scomber japon-
icus), squid and other similar species, described in the respective chapters of the areas;
highly migratory tuna species described in CHAPTER E.1, pp. 330; and highly migratory
sharks in CHAPTER E.3, pp. 388.
   The landings of demersal species vary greatly by species and region. Many species,
especially those caught by bottom fishing gears at great depths, tend to have high market
values since the respective fishing costs are high. A summary of demersal landings in 2021
by region is provided in TABLE E.2.3.

3.4 Resource status of demersal stocks in ABNJ
Defining what constitutes a fish stock in ABNJ is a similar mix of biological, social,
practical and political considerations as is the case for defining a stock elsewhere. In
practice, a stock is often a mix of a biological unit (a self-contained entity that does not
mix with other populations, especially when reproducing, so that there is only limited
migration between different stocks) and a management unit (being the entity for scientific
advice and management measures, and depending on factors such as infrastructure, fleet,
geography and political and socioeconomic arrangements). Stock assignments provided in
this chapter follow the RFMOs’ own usage for a particular species that typically defaults
to a management unit which may or may not comprise more than one biological unit.

                                   The reference list of fish species used in the previous methodology generally consisted of
                                   stocks within EEZs, or straddling stocks mainly within EEZs where only a small portion
                                   occurs in ABNJ (with the exception of tuna). Therefore, the stocks considered for ABNJ
                                   are mostly new additions to the updated methodology (TABLE E.2.4).

                                   4.1 Classification of the status of stocks
                                   Stock status for ABNJ stocks is assessed based on recent stock biomass estimates, which are
                                   typically estimated with a delay of two to four years. The estimated biomass is compared to the
                                   estimated biomass that is expected to produce maximum sustainable yield (BMSY). Stocks where
                                   estimated biomass is above 80 percent of the estimated BMSY are considered sustainable (PART
                                   B. METHODOLOGY, pp. 6). This is in line with UNCLOS (1982), Art. 119 paragraph 1(a): “to
                                   maintain or restore populations of harvested species at levels which can produce the maximum
                                   sustainable yield, as qualified by relevant environmental and economic factors”.
                                      The resource status shows considerable differences among regions (TABLE E.2.5 and
                                   TABLE E.2.6 for the list of stocks considered in this chapter). Globally, 75 demersal stocks
                                   that are fished in ABNJ are considered in this assessment. Of these, 20 stocks are considered
                                   overfished (20 percent), 13 stocks are maximally sustainably fished (19 percent), 12 stocks
                                   are underfished (17 percent), and 25 stocks are of an unknown status (36 percent).
                                      The regions with the longest catch and management history are Areas 21, 27 and 37, where
                                   most of ABNJ fisheries are managed by NAFO, NEAFC and GFCM, respectively. These
                                   regions have a total of 30 assessed stocks, of which 23 are overfished and seven are assessed as
                                   maximally sustainably fished. In addition, there are 11 stocks with an unknown status.
                                      The Antarctic Area has been managed by CCAMLR since 1982. CCAMLR was formed
                                   under the Antarctic Treaty as a result of concerns about the expansion of krill fisheries. Fisheries
                                   in this region focus mainly on toothfish and krill (PART D.16, ANTARCTIC AREA , pp. 316). These
                                   are among the most conservatively managed fisheries in the world, with 12 of 13 assessed stocks
                                   being underfished (by the FAO definition; they are managed at target levels by the CCAMLR
                                   classification) and the remaining ones being maximally sustainably fished. There are additional
                                   toothfish stocks with an unknown status, all with low catch levels and limited fishing effort.

   The regions with management in place tend to have established fisheries that previously
suffered the boom-and-bust extractivism in the 1970s–2000s period. These are the North
Pacific (managed by NPFC) and South Pacific (manged by SPRFMO), the Southeast
Atlantic (managed by SEAFO), and the Indian Ocean (managed by SIOFA). These regions
have a total of 28 stocks, with 17 stocks being so far unassessed and thus having an unknown
status. This is partly due to the short time-series of catch data, but also because these stocks
have a life-history that makes them difficult to assess. Of the assessed stocks, three are
considered overfished, and the remaining eight stocks are maximally sustainably fished.
   The only region with significant ABNJ catches not under RFMO management is the
Southwest Atlantic, where all six stocks have an unknown status. However, these ABNJ
stocks are a small transboundary extension of much larger EEZ stocks that are managed
by coastal states.

5. KEY FINDINGS
There are many challenges to both estimating current biomass and estimating the biomass
to optimize yield (BMSY), particularly for deep-sea stocks, as they often have complex
life-histories and limited data availability. Seamount species are particularly challenging to
assess. Proxies and expert judgement can be useful on occasion. There is high uncertainty
in the knowledge and status of deep-sea resources, and the majority of species encountered
in these fisheries are classified with an unknown status.
   Each RFMO manages the fish stocks in its ABNJ region, and typically has its own
definitions, usually linked to its precautionary approach framework that is based on stock
biomass and fishing mortality. Regions differ not just in terms of their history of fishing,
but also in their management institutions. It matters when the RFMO entered into force.
Regions with well-established ABNJ fisheries are the Northwest and Northeast Atlantic, the
Mediterranean, and, to a lesser extent, the Antarctic Area. Likewise, these regions have the
earliest established RFMOs (and CCAMLR) and the longest histories of collecting infor-
mation and undertaking stock assessments. The regions with newer fisheries (and these tend
to include the seamount fisheries) are in the North and South Pacific, the Southeast Atlantic,
and the Indian Ocean. In these regions, the RFMOs have been established more recently;
data and assessments are thus more limited, making stock status harder to determine.

HIGHLY MIGRATORY SHARKS
Joel Rice
Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations


1. INTRODUCTION
Sharks and their relatives – the batoids and chimaeras – stand out as a distinct category
of marine fishery resources with respect to species diversity, vulnerability and resil-
ience, resource condition and management. They comprise the chondrichthyan fishes
(TABLE E.3.1), a group of more than 1 300 species, of which more than 500 are sharks
(Fricke et al., 2025). The chimaeras are a small, mostly deep-sea group that contribute
little to fisheries landings. Discussions in this chapter focus on sharks and batoids (elas-
mobranchs), as fishery statistics for many countries report the two groups together as one
category (Lack and Sant, 2009).

   Elasmobranchs (sharks, skates and rays) are a very diverse group of fishes showing
extreme variability in some of their life history traits, including maximum size and age,
size and age at maturity, offspring size, number of offspring, gestation period, breeding
frequency, and growth rate (CITES, 2024). This diversity of life history traits includes
example species with low intrinsic rates of population increase and a limited ability to
withstand fishing pressure (Smith, Au and Show, 1998). For this reason a range of sharks
are more vulnerable to overexploitation and require appropriate management consider-
ations. As a group sharks can be viewed as a continuum that is ultimately expressed as
largely different productivity values, which affects the vulnerability of the different species
to human-induced stressors.

                                   Sustainable fisheries for sharks are possible (Simpfendorfer and Dulvy, 2017), particu-
                                larly for the smaller, faster-growing species such as the gummy shark (Mustelus antarcticus)
Highly migratory sharks




                                which has been managed through size-selective gillnet regulations for several decades
                                (Walker, 1998a, 1998b; Stevens, 1999). Even slower-growing species can be harvested
                                sustainably, but they must be very closely managed with small yields relative to biomass,
                                particularly the reproductive portion of the stock (Simpfendorfer, 1999).

                                FISHERY PROFILES
                                The world’s shark and ray fisheries have been prone to overexploitation due to fishing
                                pressure, biological characteristics and associated lower resilience, requiring precautionary
                                management. This is especially true for highly migratory shark species given they inhabit
                                the upper pelagic zones of the world’s oceans and often range widely, overlapping multiple
                                fishing grounds (Musick, 1999; Stevens et al., 2000; Schindler et al., 2002; Compagno,
                                2001). Indeed, the history of most directed shark fisheries around the world has been one
                                of overharvest, rapid stock decline, collapse and limited recovery (Bonfil, 1994). Examples
                                of such fisheries include the porbeagle (Lamna nasus) in the North Atlantic (Campana et
                                al., 2008); the tope shark (Galeorhinus galeus) off California and Australia (Ripley, 1946;
                                Olsen, 1959; Stevens, 1999); various basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus) fisheries (Parker
                                and Scott, 1965; CITES, 2002); and several picked dogfish (Squalus acanthias) fisheries
                                (Bargmann, 2009; Pawson, Ellis and Dobby, 2009; Rago and Sosebee, 2009; Wallace et
                                al., 2009).
                                   The total reported catch of sharks and their relatives increased substantially until the
                                early 2000s, and has since gradually decreased over the last two decades, from over 868 000
                                tonnes in 2000 to approximately 605 000 tonnes in 2021 (FIGURE E.3.3). However, landings
                                for highly migratory species – as listed in Annex 1 of United Nations Convention on the
                                Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) – continued to increase and peaked at over 250 000 tonnes in
                                2012, to decline to approximately 170 000 tonnes in 2021 (FIGURE E.3.4). The top five shark
                                reporting nations are Indonesia, Spain, Mexico, India and the United States of America,
                                followed by Brazil, Taiwan Province of China, Nigeria, Japan and Bangladesh. Indonesia
                                has been the top global shark and ray capture producer in recent years, with at least 105
                                species observed in Indonesian landings according to a region specific study (White and
                                Sommerville, 2010). The fisheries include a wide variety of both fixed and mobile fishing
                                gear types and a high percentage of artisanal fishers who depend on elasmobranch landings.
                                   The overall increasing trend in reported landings of sharks and rays observed since the
                                1950s, until the more recent declines, is likely due to a combination of factors related to
                                species exploitation and changes in market demand, changes in fisheries management,
                                including mandatory reporting, catch monitoring, and enhanced species breakdown in
                                reported landing statistics, although actual historical landings are likely higher in many
                                regions. The wider application of restrictions on shark finning may be leading to increased
                                landings of whole sharks, as the take of just fins is no longer permitted. It is also possible
                                that the market demand for shark meat increased in response to changes in consumer
                                preferences and marketing strategies, as traditional fisheries reach maximum levels or
                                become depleted.
                                   Shark and ray fisheries may be classified into four main categories: pelagic, coastal
                                cold-temperate, coastal tropical, and deep sea fisheries. The majority of landings come
                                from pelagic fisheries in areas beyond national jurisdictions (ABNJ). Requiem sharks
                                (Carcharhinidae) have accounted for the majority of landings over the last two decades, with
                                rajiforms making up the largest share of batoids (FIGURE E.3.1). Coastal tropical regions host
                                the highest shark and ray species diversity, which is reflected in fisheries captures (White
                                and Sommerville, 2010). Indeed, the three of the four FAO Areas with the highest aver-
                                age annual catches of sharks and rays since 1950 are tropical: the Western Central Pacific
                                (Area 71), the Eastern Indian Ocean (Area 57) and the Western Indian Ocean (Area 51)
                                (FIGURE E.3.2). Coastal cold-temperate shark and ray fisheries are dominated by the spiny
                                dogfish (also called picked dogfish, Squalus acanthias, Squalus suckleyi in the North Pacific)
                                alongside smooth hounds (Triakidae spp.) and various rajid skates (Ebert and Winton, 2010).

   Deep-sea fisheries targeting sharks have been ongoing locally over continental and
insular slopes (200–2 000 m) for several decades. These demersal fisheries typically target
deep-water dogfishes (Squaliformes) of several genera (Kyne and Simpfendorfer, 2010).
Two well-documented examples include the kitefin shark (Dalatias licha) in the Azores
and the deep-water line fishery in Suruga Bay, Japan (Kyne and Simpfendorfer, 2010; Yano
and Tanaka, 1988). Deep-water dogfishes have been targeted for their meat, but espe-
cially for their livers, which are high in squalene, (Gordon, 1999) an organic compound
used in the production of vaccines, medicines and personal health products. Catches of
deep-sea sharks increased substantially in the last decades of the twentieth century as
large industrial fisheries moved from continental shelves (where certain fish stocks were
depleted) to continental slopes (Merrett and Haedrich, 1997). The targets of these fish-
eries were bony fishes, but sharks made up a substantial part of the nontarget catch, some
of which was landed, some discarded. Kyne and Simpfendorfer (2010) show that for the
Australian scalefish and shark fishery, deep-sea shark abundance over a 30-year period
dropped by 75–99 percent, depending on species. Gulper sharks (Centrophorus spp.)
were the most heavily affected. In the Northeast Atlantic deep-water fisheries, gulper
sharks, Portuguese dogfish (Centroscymnus coelolepis) and birdbeak dogfish (Deania
spp.) declined by 62–99 percent between the late 1970s and the early 2000s (Kyne and
Simpfendorfer, 2010). Deep-sea squaliform sharks have inherently slow growth rates
and live in deep, cold water where food resources are limited (Kyne and Simpfendorfer,
2010). Such species have very limited capacity to respond to fishing pressure and can be
harvested only at very low ratios of yield to standing stock. When taken in mixed species
fisheries supported by more productive teleosts, deep-sea shark populations have declined
rapidly and local extirpations have occurred.

                                   Although some international longline fleets specifically target sharks, most distant-wa-
                                ter longline operations primarily pursue tunas and billfishes. However, these are effectively
                                mixed shark/tuna/billfish fisheries, as they catch large numbers of sharks incidentally
                                (Camhi, Pikitch, & Babcock, 2008; Stevens, 2010). Highly migratory shark species are
                                also caught in both targeted and incidental fisheries, especially in longline, purse seine,
                                gillnet and midwater trawl fisheries aimed at tuna, swordfish and small pelagic species
                                (Clarke et al., 2006). While directed shark fisheries have led to stock declines and collapse
                                of some elasmobranch species, the greatest global threats stem from bycatch in mixed fish-
                                eries and other operations targeting more productive teleost species; this is especially the
                                case for highly migratory shark species (Musick, 1999; Stevens et al., 2000; Schindler et
                                al., 2002; Compagno, 2001; Rice and Harley, 2012; Rice and Harley, 2013; Rice, 2018;
                                ICCAT, 2020; Coelho et al. 2024)
                                   Although there is variation in demographic rates among shark and ray species, the
                                combination of broad distribution, high bycatch rates, and slow population growth
                                renders many of these species increasingly at risk (Cortés, 2000; Dulvey et al., 2008).
                                Traditional harvest strategies designed to maximize economic and social benefits from
                                single or multi-species fisheries have a high probability of depleting the least-productive
                                species (such as sharks), while maintaining a robust target stock.

   The FAO International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of
Sharks (IPOA-Sharks) was adopted in 1999 as part of FAO’s Code of Conduct for
Responsible Fisheries, in response to growing global concerns about the sustainability
of shark populations. It is a voluntary international framework that encourages all FAO
Members to assess the status of their shark fisheries and adopt a National Plan of Action
for Sharks (NPOA-Sharks) if their sharks are found to be at risk. Its objectives include
improving species-specific catch and landing data, reducing bycatch, and enhancing the
conservation and management of shark species. Initially, progress was slow due to limited
capacity, insufficient data, and a lack of political will in some regions. Indeed, many coun-
tries delayed adopting a NPOA-Sharks due to technical and financial constraints, as well
as challenges in monitoring and enforcing shark-specific measures. Recently, however,
increased awareness of the ecological importance of sharks and international pressure
from conservation organizations have spurred action, although there are challenges such
as resource limitations and competing priorities.
   Progress has been made on data collection and reporting, especially reporting to
species level. These improvements in data have led to improved scientific research, bycatch
mitigation and stock assessments; for example, blue shark (Prionace glauca), silky shark
(Carcharhinus falciformis), oceanic whitetip (Carcharhinus longimanus) and others have
been assessed for the first time in the last decade (Rice and Harley, 2012, 2013; Rice et
al., 2013; Rice and Sharma, 2015). Although the IPOA-Sharks has been a catalyst for
international cooperation, its voluntary nature means that progress is uneven, especially
at smaller regional scales. Fisheries in ABNJ managed by regional fisheries management
organizations (RFMOs) and nations with highly regulated fisheries that are subject to
monitoring and control have made the most progress. Strengthening technical and finan-
cial assistance to developing nations and fostering regional collaboration remain crucial
for its long-term success.
   The inclusion of many shark species in international agreements like the Convention
on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and
the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) complements the IPOA-Sharks. The most
influential among these is CITES, which regulates or prohibits international trade in
threatened species. Over the years, the number of sharks and rays listed under CITES
Appendices has increased significantly, reflecting growing concern over their conserva-
tion status. Currently, all species of sawfish (family Pristidae) are listed under Appendix
I, which prohibits international trade except in exceptional circumstances. Meanwhile,
numerous shark and ray species – such as the oceanic whitetip shark, hammerhead sharks
(Sphyrnidae), the silky shark and manta rays (Mobula spp.) – are listed under Appendix
II, allowing regulated trade to prevent overexploitation. Wedgefishes (Rhynchobatus spp.),
giant guitarfishes (Glaucostegus spp.) and the shortfin mako shark (Isurus oxyrinchus) were
also recently added to Appendix II, highlighting the escalating threat to elasmobranch
populations due to overfishing and habitat loss. Further proposals to list additional species
are expected as scientific evidence continues to highlight the vulnerability of these animals
to global trade pressures. CITES remains a critical mechanism for driving international
cooperation to ensure the sustainability of shark and ray populations.
   Finally, major tuna RFMOs have also adopted many shark-specific conservation and
management measures. These include measures regarding the full utilization of sharks,
prohibiting shark finning (removal of fins and discarding of the carcass), protecting
specific shark species (e.g. oceanic whitetip shark), mandating data collection and report-
ing, and mitigating bycatch (TABLE E.3.2). These have contributed to driving progress
towards countries’ adopting formal NPOA-Sharks, including major shark-fishing nations
such as Australia, the United States of America, and the European Union.

                                data is sparse, with species-specific catch statistics especially lacking; nonetheless, data
                                may be available for aggregations and labeled as general “not elsewhere indicated” (NEI)
                                (FIGURE E.3.3). This lack of species identification of the catches and lack of information
                                on fishing effort means basic data for stock assessment are usually not available, and must

be estimated or inferred from other sources. Data collection and management of highly
migratory shark species in particular has historically been difficult due to added challenges
of high mobility for assessments. In addition, species catch data aggregated into higher
groups can easily mask declines of individual species or with certain regions. Dulvy and
Forrest (2010) provide examples of larger, slower-growing sharks being replaced by smaller,
faster-growing species with no apparent changes in landings data for the group.
   Nonetheless, the total reported as NEI species has decreased over the last two decades
(FIGURE E.3.3). In fact, the observed increase in landings of sharks and their relatives
reported at species level reflects improved species identification and reporting by shark
fishing nations that used to report shark catches in highly aggregated taxonomic cate-
gories. For instance, in the same period of increasing catches of highly migratory sharks
there has been a decreasing trend in unidentified landings reported as “Elasmobranchii”
(sharks, rays, skates, etc. NEI), from about 694 000 tonnes in the early 2000s to under
385 000 tonnes in 2021.

Highly migratory sharks




                                This section identifies and discusses key shark and ray species, especially those that are
                                highly migratory given that the regional chapters (PART D, pp. 66) of this report cover
                                coastal species. Over the last two decades, 23 species of highly migratory sharks have been
                                assessed by tuna RFMOs (including two NEI groups). The trends in global landings of
                                highly migratory shark species are set out in FIGURE E.3.4 below.

                                4.1 Blue shark
                                Within requiem sharks and their relatives (Carcharhiniformes), the blue shark (Prionace
                                glauca) is by far the most common of the dozen or so commercially important shark
                                species captured (FIGURE E.3.5). They are found in temperate and tropical oceans across
                                the globe, and are often caught incidentally in high seas longline and drift gillnet fisheries
                                targeting tuna and swordfish. Despite its relatively fast growth and higher reproductive
                                output compared to other large sharks, the blue shark is still vulnerable to overexploitation
                                due to the sheer volume of catch. It represents one of the highest reported shark catches
                                globally, both in terms of landings and discards.
                                   Over the last two decades, reported landings have risen from approximately 8 000
                                tonnes in 1996 to about 51 000 tonnes in 2000, with a peak at over 167 000 tonnes in
                                2012, and recently stabilizing at between about 111 000 tonnes and 122 000 tonnes
                                in recent years (2017 to 2021). At the regional level, trends in the blue shark landings
                                between 1950 and 2021 (FIGURE E.3.5) show a peak of more than 34 000 tonnes in the

Eastern Central Atlantic in 2013, followed by a decline. The highest cumulative landings
of blue shark between 1950 and 2021 come from the Eastern Indian Ocean, followed by
the Eastern Central Atlantic and the Northeast Atlantic. These nominal reported land-
ings likely underestimate the actual blue shark fishery removals, due in part to the large
amounts of sharks reported as “NEI” as well as the practice of finning and discarding the
carcasses at sea (Camhi, Pickitch and Babcock, 2008). Historically, blue shark fins have
been five times more common than any other pelagic species in the fin trade in China,
Hong Kong SAR. Estimates of the total shark biomass required to support the docu-
mented global shark fin trade (all species) annually exceeded the total landings reported
to FAO by a factor of three to four in 2000 (Clarke et al., 2006). In some regions, targeted
shark fisheries existed with little to no control of the catches and limited reporting beyond
total landings (Clarke et al., 2006).
   While blue shark are currently classified as sustainably fished in nearly all regions, signs of
population stress have emerged, particularly in the North Atlantic, where catch rates have
declined in some long-term datasets. The status of one stock of blue shark remains unknown.
Blue shark are listed as Near Threatened on the International Union for Conservation of
Nature (IUCN) Red List, List, and growing concern over their status has led to increased
calls for improved monitoring, reporting and international management measures.

4.2 Dogfishes
Spiny dogfish (also known as picked dogfish, Squalus acanthias) landings remain particu-
larly notable in global fisheries data, second only to blue shark for landings reported to
species. Trends show that the Northeast Atlantic (Area 61) historically accounted for
the highest total dogfish landings which peaked at 50 200 tonnes in 1972, followed

Highly migratory sharks




                                (FIGURE E.3.6). Trends indicate a steep decline in dogfish catches in the Northeast Atlantic
                                to around 5 000 tonnes in 2021, prompting the IUCN to maintain its listing as Critically
                                Endangered. In parallel, historical overfishing in the Northwest Atlantic (Area 21),
                                which had previously led to recruitment failures, has since been mitigated by stricter
                                management controls. Finally, landings data from the Southwest Pacific (Area 81) have
                                been relatively stable since 1990.

                                4.3 Basking, great white and longfin mako sharks
                                As the second-largest fish in the ocean, the basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus) was
                                heavily hunted throughout the twentieth century for its large liver, which is rich in is rich
                                in oil, as well as for meat, fins and cartilage. Targeted fisheries operated in the Northeast
                                Atlantic, including off the coasts of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
                                Ireland, Ireland and Norway, leading to significant population declines. Reported land-
                                ings in excess of 8 000 tonnes were common during the period from 1960 to 1980, but
                                they have been much less since the end of the 1990s and almost nonexistent since 2009
                                (with the exception of 2012), with 0.12 tonnes reported in 2021 (FIGURE E.3.7). Although
                                most targeted fisheries have now ceased, the species remains at risk from incidental capture
                                in various gear types, including trawls, gillnets and longlines. In recognition of these
                                vulnerabilities, and the lack of data on regional abundance or population trends, the
                                basking shark is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List and is protected under several
                                international agreements, including CITES Appendix II and CMS Appendix I and II.
                                Despite these protections, ongoing threats from bycatch and the species’ low reproductive

    The great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) is another iconic pelagic species that is
highly vulnerable to overexploitation. Historically targeted for its jaws, teeth, fins and as a
trophy species, the great white shark has also suffered from high levels of bycatch in commer-
cial and recreational fisheries (Dudley and Simpfendorfer, 2006). Despite their widespread
distribution across temperate and subtropical oceans, great whites often aggregate in predict-
able coastal areas, increasing their exposure to fishing and habitat disturbance. Since 1950,
there have only been 11 years in which landings of great white shark have been reported. Of
these, none have exceeded 25 tonnes (which was the peak in 2013), with multiple years of
zero reported catches (FIGURE E.3.7). The species is listed as CITES Appendix II and CMS
Appendix I and II, and is classified as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List globally, with some
regional populations facing even greater risk. Legal protections now exist in many countries,
including complete prohibitions on targeted fishing and retention, but the species continues
to be threatened by bycatch, illegal trade, and habitat degradation. Effective enforcement of
conservation measures and continued monitoring are essential to prevent further decline
and to support the recovery of great white shark populations worldwide. The status of the
great white shark remains unknown.
    The longfin mako (Isurus paucus) is one of the least understood pelagic shark species,
making its conservation particularly challenging. Its distribution is poorly known, and due
to its rarity and close resemblance to the more abundant shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus), it
is likely that longfin mako are frequently misidentified or included in landing data for short-
fin species, masking accurate assessments of population status. Historical reported landings
ranged between 1 tonne and 5 tonnes from the early 1990s until 2013 when reported land-
ings began increasing, with nearly 300 tonnes reported in 2017 (FIGURE E.3.7). The lack of
reliable data poses significant obstacles for effective management and highlights the need
for a precautionary approach in any fisheries that may capture this species. The longfin mako
is listed on Appendix II of both the CMS and CITES, signalling the need for international
cooperation and monitoring to ensure its conservation. The status of the great white shark
remains unknown as of 2021.

                                4.4 Shortfin mako shark
Highly migratory sharks




                                The shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus) is a fast-swimming, highly migratory shark that has
                                been heavily exploited in global fisheries, both as a targeted species and as bycatch. Valued
                                for its meat, fins and sport fishing appeal, the shortfin mako has experienced significant
                                fishing pressure, particularly in high seas longline fisheries targeting tuna and swordfish.
                                Reporting of landings for shortfin mako shark began in 1981 and increased through the
                                1990s until the mid-2010s in all major ocean basins; in 2021, reported landings were
                                found to be just over 9 300 tonnes (FIGURE E.3.8). The apparent increase in landings may be
                                due to increased reporting requirements, changes in markets, or both. Stock assessments
                                have shown that populations in the Atlantic Ocean were overfished in 2021. In response,
                                management bodies such as the International Commission for the Conservation of
                                Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) have adopted measures including catch limits and retention bans
                                to mitigate further declines. In the Indian Ocean, stocks of shortfin mako were maximally
                                sustainably fished in 2021, while the stock in the Pacific South was overfished, and the one
                                in Pacific North was underfished in 2021. The shortfin mako is listed on Appendix II of
                                both CITES and CMS, reflecting international concern for its status; this listing may be
                                responsible for the recent decline in landings in some regions (FIGURE E.3.8). Additionally,
                                the IUCN Red List categorizes the species as Endangered globally. Continued enforcement
                                of conservation measures, improved landings reporting and further research on population
                                trends are crucial to ensuring the long-term survival of this species.

4.5 Thresher sharks
Thresher sharks (family Alopiidae), particularly bigeye (Alopias superciliosus) and pelagic
(Alopias pelagicus) species, are frequently caught in pelagic longline and gillnet fisheries
targeting tuna and swordfish, often without specific management or catch reporting.
Trends (FIGURE E.3.9) show that pelagic thresher shark landings in the southeast and
Eastern Central Pacific rose sharply from the mid-2000s, peaking in 2013 at nearly 7
000 tonnes before declining significantly in the following years. Landings of thresher
sharks not identified to species level in the Eastern Indian Ocean show a steady increase
from the early 1990s, peaking intermittently over the last decade, suggesting continued
fishing pressure; these may represent landings of the common thresher (Alopias vulpinus).
Reported landings of bigeye thresher show a rise to 1 224 tonnes in 2020, with a decrease
to 948 tonnes in 2021. The decline in reported landings, particularly for bigeye thresher,
may reflect both reduced populations and improved identification or reporting, though
the absence of robust population data necessitates a precautionary management approach.
The status of most thresher sharks is unknown, although one assessed stock in the Pacific
is considered underfished. Thresher sharks are listed on CITES Appendix II, highlighting
international concern for their conservation and the need for stronger regulation of trade
and fishing practices.

                                4.6 Porbeagle shark
Highly migratory sharks




                                The porbeagle shark (Lamna nasus) has experienced significant population declines,
                                particularly in the North Atlantic, where it has historically been most heavily fished and
                                therefore from where landings have primarily been reported. North Atlantic landings
                                peaked in 1964 at over 9 600 tonnes but have since plummeted, reaching minimal levels
                                after 2010 (FIGURE E.3.10). This sharp decline reflects both possible population depletion
                                and the implementation of stricter management measures following concerns about stock
                                sustainability. The North Atlantic stock is currently listed as Critically Endangered by
                                the IUCN, with some regional populations (such as in the Northeast Atlantic) still under
                                moratoriums or strict quotas due to their depleted state and slow recovery potential.
                                In contrast, the Southern Hemisphere populations of porbeagle shark have been less
                                exploited, although they are still subject to fishing pressure and remain poorly studied.
                                All assessed stocks of porbeagle shark were considered overfished in 2021. In addition,
                                porbeagle shark are listed on Appendix II of CITES and CMS, emphasizing the need
                                for international cooperation to ensure their long-term conservation and recovery. A
                                precautionary approach to their management is useful given these listings and the lack
                                of comprehensive data for these southern populations.

4.7 Silky and oceanic whitetip sharks
The silky shark (Carcharhinus falciformis) is a highly migratory pelagic species that is among
the most frequently caught sharks in tuna purse seine and longline fisheries, especially
in tropical and subtropical oceans. Its abundance in these fisheries, combined with high
market demand for fins, has led to intense fishing pressure. Silky shark are often taken as
bycatch, particularly around fish aggregating devices (FADs), where juveniles are commonly
encountered. Landings in the Indian Ocean are estimated to have peaked in 1999 at nearly
25 000 tonnes (FIGURE E.3.11). Although the species has a faster growth rate and higher
fecundity than some other large sharks, it still exhibits key life history traits – such as late
maturity and relatively slow reproduction – that limit its ability to withstand sustained
fishing mortality. Population declines of 70 percent or more have been reported in several
ocean basins, prompting concern about its conservation status. In response, the silky shark
was listed on CITES Appendix II in 2016, and it is also included in CMS Appendix II
and listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. RFMOs such as ICCAT have introduced
measures to reduce mortality, including prohibiting retention in some fisheries. Nevertheless,
ongoing bycatch and insufficient enforcement remain challenges. Currently, stocks of silky
shark in the Indian Ocean are considered underfished to maximally sustainably fished in
2021, and in the Pacific overfished to maximally sustainably fished.
   Once one of the most widespread and abundant pelagic sharks, the oceanic whitetip
shark (Carcharhinus longimanus), has seen a dramatic decline in population due to overfish-
ing and habitat degradation. Historically, this shark was found in tropical and subtropical
waters across the world’s oceans, but its range has been significantly reduced. Conservation
efforts are underway to protect the species, but continued threats from unsustainable fishing
practices and the loss of prey species pose ongoing challenges for its recovery. It is currently
considered to be overfished in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, with catch rates and catches
declining in recent years (FIGURE E.3.11). Currently, the oceanic whitetip shark stock in the
Indian Ocean is considered maximally sustainably fished in 2021, and in the Pacific Ocean
overfished. It is also currently classified as Critically Endangered by the IUCN.

Highly migratory sharks




                                Coastal tropical regions host the highest shark and ray species diversity (White and
                                Sommerville, 2010). Among batoids, stingrays (Myliobatiform rays), guitarfishes
                                (Rhinobatidae) and wedgefishes (Rhynchobatidae) are the larger fishery components, with
                                the largest landings reported in the Western Central Pacific, Indian Ocean, and Eastern
                                Central Atlantic (FIGURE E.3.12). The fisheries in these regions rely on a combination of
                                fixed and mobile gear types, with a high proportion of artisanal fishers depending on
                                elasmobranch landings for their livelihoods.

5. KEY FINDINGS
Shark species show biological vulnerabilities and have historically faced overexploitation.
Despite some successful management cases, global trends underscore persistent threats
from targeted fishing as well as bycatch. While the total global landings of sharks has
declined from its peak in the early 2000s, the risk of overfishing due to bycatch still
remains high for many species. Nevertheless, regional and international cooperation has
broadened the stakeholder involvement in shark conservation and management, which
in turn has improved the outlook for many species. For instance, more than 20 countries
have adopted NPOAs-Sharks.
   Despite some improvements in data collection and reporting, many species remain
poorly monitored, and several – such as the basking, great white and shortfin mako
sharks – are listed as endangered or critically endangered. Other species (e.g. longfin mako)
are so rarely caught in recent years that their population status remains unknown, but
this does not remove the possibility of depletion, given their low productivity.
   Finally, the ustainable use and conservation of sharks, and highly migratory sharks
in particular, requires coordinated, science-based, and enforceable international efforts.
These species traverse vast ocean areas, which necessitates strengthened international
cooperation and implementation/enforcement of conservation and management meas-
ures, catch reporting and bycatch reduction. Catch limits, which are based on sound stock
assessments, are necessary for the management of many species, and these assessments
in turn rely on rigorous studies of age, growth, reproduction and movement. Long term
monitoring, improved data collection, and continued cooperation and research will help
sustainbly use and conserve highly migratory shark populations for years to come.

APPENDIX I
METHODOLOGY FOR ESTIMATING LANDINGS OF ASSESSED
SPECIES NOT MAPPED TO FAO FISHSTAT DATABASE
For species that were assessed but could not be directly matched to the landings of the
FAO FishStat database, the following multi-level taxonomic allocation approach was
applied. The majority of these species are reported in FAO Areas 51, 57 and 71, where
data collection was more limited in some regions or subareas.

1. TAXONOMIC-LEVEL ALLOCATION
Landing data were distributed across taxonomic levels, using a scaling factor that increased
as specificity decreased (i.e. from genus, to family, order or class, to marine fishes not
elsewhere identified [nei]) depending on the data available.
a. Genus-level example:
In cases where the species (e.g. Epinephelus morio) had no reported landings data for a
given FAO Major Fishing Area X, landings were assigned at the genus level. Specifically,
the species was assigned the total landings of Epinephelus spp. in Area X for 2021, denoted
as Lg,X. A genus-level factor of fg,X was then applied (i.e. fg,X is the number of species assigned
to a given genus for a given FAO Area X, in this case if there was only one species not
assigned to this genus it would be 1, if there were two, it would 2, and so on), representing
the total number of species with no individual landing data in FishStat and grouped under
Epinephelus spp. at the genus level in FAO Area X.
   Assumption: Other species within the genus were properly identified and listed in
FishStat.
b. Family-level example:
In cases where the species (e.g. Saurida undosquamis) had no reported landings data for
a given FAO Major Fishing Area X, landings were assigned at family level. Specifically,
the species was assigned the total landings of Synodontidae in FAO Area X in 2021,
denoted as Lf,X. A family-level factor ff,X was then applied (a similar factor was applied
to the one above for the family level), representing the total number of species with no
individual landing data in FishStat and grouped under Synodontidae at the family level
in FAO Area X.
   Assumption: Other species within the family were properly identified and listed in
FishStat.
c. Order-level example:
In cases where the species (e.g. Encrasicholina heteroloba) had no landing data in FAO
Major Fishing Area X, landings were assigned at order level. Specifically, the species was
assigned the total landings of Clupeiformes in FAO Area X in 2021, denoted as Lo,X. An
order-level factor fo,X was then applied, representing the total number of species with no
landing data in FishStat and grouped under Clupeiformes at the order level in FAO Area X.
   Assumption: Other species within the order were properly identified and listed in
FishStat.

                   2. CLASS-LEVEL ALLOCATION
                   If a given species with no reported landing data in FAO Major Fishing Area X belonged
                   to class c, it was assigned class-level landings Lc,X, representing the total catch for class c in
Appendix I




                   FAO Area X in 2021. As such, in this case, only landings of whatever class it corresponded
                   to (e.g. marine fish nei) would be associated with the given species.
                   a. Marine fishes nei
                   If a given species with no reported landing data in FAO Major Fishing Area X corresponded
                   to the category “marine fishes nei” (which broadly encompasses all marine bony fish species
                   not identified elsewhere) at the class level, the scaling factor was adjusted accordingly to
                   account for this aggregation as follows:


                     Where:
                    The number 4 was used to down-weight this category, as we are already accounting for
                      3 other categories; genus family and order (this is the 4th class)
                    f´c,X is the adjusted scaling factor for the given species in FAO Area X
                    fc,X is the original scaling factor for the given species in FAO Area X, representing the
                      number of species with no landings assigned to the species at the class level in FAO
                      Area X
                    |X| is the number of assessed species (which includes all species in Area X assessed in
                      FishStat J)in FAO Area X
                    |Xm| is the number of assessed species (which includes classes other than marine
                      fished) with missing landings in FAO Area X.


                   b. All other classes
                   All species corresponding to classes other than “marine fishes nei” were assigned the original
                   scaling factor fc,X, representing the number of species with no reported landings assigned to
                   the same class c in FAO Major Fishing Area X.

                   3. HANDLING OVERLAPS AND DOUBLE COUNTING
                   If a proxy species (used for unmatched assignment) overlapped with a species already reported
                   in the same area, the following adjustment was applied:
                    The reported species’ landings were reduced to 75 percent of their original value.
                    The remaining 25 percent was assigned to the proxy species to avoid double counting,
                      i.e. the landings for level l in FAO Area X were adjusted to:



                   4. FINAL ESTIMATION OF LANDINGS FOR
                   UNMATCHED SPECIES
                   After applying the adjustments in steps 1 and 2, each species with missing landings was
                   assigned an estimated landing based on:
Appendix I ■ Special Topics ■ Sharks                                                           413




     Where:
 Ls,X are the new assigned landings to species s in FAO Area X
 Ll,X are the landings at level l (ranging over genus, family, order and class levels) in
     FAO Area X
 fl,X is the scaling factor at level l in FAO Area X.


EXAMPLE: Trachurus novaezelandiae IN FAO AREA 81
a. Assignment across taxonomic and class levels
For the species Trachurus novaezelandiae, we have the following mapping across taxo-
nomic and class levels:

 Species             Genus             Family            Order             Class
 Trachurus           Jack and horse
                                       Carangids NEI     Percoids NEI      Marine fishes NEI
 novaezelandiae      mackerels NEI


b. Landings across taxonomic and class levels
Using these mappings, we retrieve the reported landings from FishStat for each level in
FAO Area 81.

     REPORTED LANDINGS 2021 IN FISHSTAT FOR FAO AREA 81 IN TONNES

 Species             Genus             Family            Order             Class

 0                   45 722.97         3 175.69          11.8              461.27


  We must adjust these landings based on the presence of stocks in Area 81 which already
match the genus, family, order, or class assigned to Trachurus novaezelandiae. This ensures
we do not double count landings at these levels.
  The genus level (Jack and horse mackerels NEI) is already contained in the assess-
ment in Area 81. Thus, we adjust the landings on each level to be allocated to Trachurus
novaezelandiae to 25% of those reported in FishStat.

     LANDINGS FOR ALLOCATION TO Trachurus novaezelandiae IN FAO AREA 81 IN
     TONNES

 0                   11 430.74         3 175.69          11.8              461.27


   The assessed stocks corresponding to Jack and horse mackerels NEI already reported
in Area 81 are allocated the remaining 75% (34 292.22 tonnes) of their total landings
for the area.

                   c. Scaling factor across taxonomic and class level
                   For each level, we assign a scaling factor to Trachurus novaezelandiae based on the number
                   of species with no reported catch assigned to the same taxonomic/class level.
Appendix I




                      For the taxonomic levels (genus, family, and order), Trachurus novaezelandiae is the
                   only species assigned to Jack and horse mackerels NEI, Carangids NEI, and Percoids
                   NEI. Therefore, Trachurus novaezelandiae receives a scaling factor of 1 on the genus,
                   family, and order level.
                      For the class level, there are 23 species assigned to Marine fishes NEI. However, since
                   the class is Marine fishes NEI, the scaling factor needs to be further adjusted, instead of
                   simply assigning Trachurus novaezelandiae a class scaling factor of 23.
                      In Area 81, there are 96 species reported in the assessment. Of these 96 species, 36
                   of them do not have catch data reported in FishStat. This gives an adjusted class scaling
                   factor of




                     Then, for Trachurus novaezelandiae we have scaling factors across all levels:

                     SCALING FACTORS FOR Trachurus novaezelandiae IN FAO AREA 81

                          Species          Genus             Family              Order                        Class

                    N/A               1                 1                 1                           245.33


                   d. Calculation of assigned landings
                   Now that we have the landings and scaling factors at each level, we can calculate the
                   assigned landings for Trachurus novaezelandiae in FAO Area 81, which comes out to be
                   approximately 14 620 tonnes:

This publication presents an updated methodology, assessment and review of
the current status of the world’s marine fishery resources. It is based primarily on
stock assessments and complementary information, and official catch statistics
through to 2021. The introductory and methodology chapters set out the wider
context, highlighting evolutions in the landscape of fisheries and stock assessment
capacities since the previous edition of this report in 2011. The updated FAO
methodology for assessing the state of stocks is presented in detail. A global
overview chapter explores major trends, while regional chapters cover the status
of stocks across the FAO Major Fishing Areas. Special sections address key issues
such as tunas and tuna-like species, deep-sea fisheries in areas beyond national
jurisdiction, and highly migratory sharks. Summary tables for each species
grouping used in this assessment present the number of stocks assessed, their
sustainability classification, and their tier based on the availability and quality of
information. The document aims to provide policymakers, academia, civil society,
fishers and managers of fishery resources with a comprehensive, objective, and
global review of the state of world marine fishery resources.
